### Setting ###

`Players` are all students at Miskatonic University,
in Dunwich, Massachusetts, along the eponymous river.
Naturally, the `Players` have varying skills and abilities,
ranging from psychological analysis to military training.
They're abroad, studying late Antiquity Roman Ruins in Northern Africa,
under the tutelage of Professor Cameron T. 'Trenton' Birchwell.


### Inciting Incident ###

The `Players` are ambushed while on an expedition.


### Complication ###

The students wake up, with the Laboratory burning around them.
They must find their way out into the cold, but thawing morning.
The Students uncover the professor's research, but it's completely incoherent.
They cannot make out what he's done, so they have to figure it out themselves.


### Crisis ###

The students find **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** in the jungle, and confront him.
They can attack the professor, talk to him about where he's been, etc.


### Resolution ###

They find **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL**, and realize what he's done.
They have to stop what **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** has started.
