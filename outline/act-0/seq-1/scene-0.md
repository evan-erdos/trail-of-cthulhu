### Scene 0 : *An Unusual Lecture* ###

**[Professor Birchwell][]** behaves strangely one day in lecture.
He gives the whole class a very strange assignment:

> I want each of you to do something you know to be ethically wrong.
> Come to the next lecture with half a page about the experience.
>
> Or... don't. It's all... pointless... class is dismissed early.

At this moment, a small fire breaks out in a nearby fume hood.

**[Professor Birchwell][]** watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.
Some students put it out, and the Professor dismisses the class.
