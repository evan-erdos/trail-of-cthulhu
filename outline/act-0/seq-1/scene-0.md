### Scene 0 : *Red Journalism* ###

The next day, the **[Players][]** shuffle in late the back of the main lab,
where **[Professor Birchwell][]** is giving a lecture, but is behaving very strangely.

Presently, the **[Players][]** are distracted by weird clinking noises.
They notice **[Dolya Petrovna][]** fooling around under the lab tables behind them.

**[Professor Birchwell][]** rambles on about mythology for a short while,
and then takes an unexpected turn into what ethics *really* mean.

After a brief interrogation, they determine that **[Dolya Petrovna][]** is a Soviet reporter.

At this point, **[Professor Birchwell][]** begins to speak very loudly.
He gives the class a very strange assignment:

> I want each of you to do something you know to be ethically wrong.
> Come to the next lecture with half a page about the experience.
>
> Or... don't. It's all... pointless... class is...

As he says "class", **[Dolya Petrovna][]** makes an attempt to escape,
but knocks over a small vial as she does so,
causing a small fire to break out below a nearby fume hood.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.
Some students put it out, and the Professor dismisses the class.


#### Clues ####
- **[Professor Birchwell][]** is under the influence of an Outer God
