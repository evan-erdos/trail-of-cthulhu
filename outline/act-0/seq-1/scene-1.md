### Scene 1 : *A Bad Diagnosis* ###

They return to the village to present the chief with their findings.
The **Chieftain** characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.
As they talk with the **Chieftain**, they notice **[Professor Birchwell][]** slip away into the woods.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He walks directly into the woods, and comes to a stop in the middle of a small bridge over a tiny creek.
The **[Players][]** hide in the brush, slightly downstream.
The sound of the water prevents **[Professor Birchwell][]** from hearing them approach.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone they can't see, on the other side of the bridge.
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the **[Players][]**, but says nothing to the man.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** departs towards the village.
The **[Players][]** run through the woods to arrive before him, seeking to avoid suspicion.

The **[Players][]** must now decide whether to investigate the other tribe, or  **Chieftain** characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.


#### Clues ####
