### Scene 3 : *"...which is a building, which is on fire..."* ###

**[Players][]** don't get to the assignment, because the lab catches fire.
They awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their rooms.
On their way out, they observe some of their peers doing very strange things.

The **[Players][]** travel through a section of the building which has caved in.
A **Crying Student** is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.
If the **[Players][]** attempt to save him (or if they mention there's a window he can escape through), he says:

> No! You can't! Don't leave! I have to get through! No! NO!
> The door! The door! If I don't get through, they'll kill me!

If they continue to try to reason with him, he attacks.
As they pass **[Professor Birchwell][]**'s office, they grab whatever they can.
An **Incensed Student** bars the door as they try to leave, they can:
  * kill the **Incensed Student** to escape
  * leave the **Incensed Student** to his fate
  * actively attempt to save the **Incensed Student**

They rush out, into the "thawing frost of a new day".


#### Clues ####
- the students have been possessed
- the professor started the fire to destroy his research, in an insane attempt to drive Cthuhu out of his mindâ€¨
- some parts of the Lab aren't burned, they've been smashed.
- *Birchwell's Notes* are gibberish, but one passage is legible:

> The sleeping god must not awaken. It is a danger to the world.
> The Yellow Demon may be a good force in all of this, and...
