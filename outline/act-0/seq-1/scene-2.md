### Scene 2 : *Paranoia* ###

Back at the lab, **[Professor Birchwell][]** screams at the **[Players][]**,
almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets, and his research.
He accuses them of watching him all the time, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go.


#### Clues ####
- **[Professor Birchwell][]** saw something in the woods, but isn't sure
