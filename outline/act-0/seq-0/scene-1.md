### Scene 1 : *An Unusual Lecture* ###

**PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** behaves strangely one day in lecture.
He gives the whole class a very strange assignment:

> I want each of you to do something you know to be ethically wrong.
> Come to the next lecture with half a page about the experience.
>
> Or... don't. It's all... pointless... class is dismissed early.

At this moment, a small fire breaks out in a nearby fume hood.

**PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.
Some students put it out, and the Professor dismisses the class.

#### Clues ####

- **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** is under the influence of an `Outer God`.
- the fire was started by somebody, it didn't just happen to occur
