### Scene 2 : *Chieftain's Remorse* ###

They find the village leader, and ask him about the symbol they found.
The **Chieftain** is confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.
He says it's from a neighboring tribe, who he considers to be "demon worshippers".
He blames them for the "curse" set upon his tribe.
He also mentions that strange men in uniforms were seen to the west.

Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".
As he speaks, it becomes clear that his hatred for this other tribe has clouded his judgement.
If the **[Players][]** press him, he reveals that his only son was taken.
His son disappeared without warning, a month before the village began to have problems.
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.
The **[Players][]** gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.


#### Clues ####
- the "demon" is Hastur, and the cultists are trying to summon him
- The uniformed men are Soviet troops who have taken an interest in the tribe
- the Soviets, not the other tribe, took the villagers
- the chief's son left on his own accord
- he was possessed by Cthulhu, not Hastur, and is working with the other tribe
