### Scene 3 : *Without A Cure* ###

On the way back to the laboratory, the **[Players][]** walk past their broken-down van.
They notice damage that wasn't there before, which would imply that there was a skirmish nearby.
As the expedition continues to the laboratory, they hear strange things in the woods.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** instructs them to ignore it, and they arrive back at the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.
Upon hearing this, **[Professor Birchwell][]** says simply,

> It begins.


#### Clues ####
- if they look closely, there's bullet holes and slices in the hull of the van
- this would point to a conflict between the Soviets and someone else
- there are no matches because they're not sick, it's Cthulhu
- the professor knows what's going on, but won't tell the **[Players][]**
