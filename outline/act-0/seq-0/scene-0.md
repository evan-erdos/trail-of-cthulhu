### Scene 0 : *Meet Interesting People, and Kill Them* ###

**[Professor Birchwell][]** takes the students on an expedition to a village.
Their destination is a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins,
which stretch along the sandy coastline of Northeastern Africa.
A rash of sleep disturbances were recently reported by the tribes,
and **[Professor Birchwell][]** was sent to investigate and diagnose it.

Along the way, they blow a tire and have to continue on foot.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** becomes irate with the driver, but it's not his fault.
Suddenly, his enraged face vanishes, and is replaced by a blank stare.
The caravan continues on, and they make camp just outside the ruins.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen, each of which wears a strange necklace.
The **[Players][]** witness **[Professor Birchwell][]** kill one, and take his necklace.
The tribesmen disperse at the sound of the first gunshot, however,
**[Professor Birchwell][]** continues to shoot at them, long after their retreat.

When **[Professor Birchwell][]** notices the **[Players][]**,
he nonchalantly asks them to carry the necklace back to the lab.
He still has blood on him, but he doesn't appear to notice.


#### Clues ####
- the professor's weird temper is not what it seems, his corruption by Cthulhu has already begun
- their necklaces are actually *[Talismans of the Yellow Sign][talisman]*
