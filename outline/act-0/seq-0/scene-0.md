### Scene 0 : *Meet Interesting People, and Kill Them* ###

**[Professor Birchwell][]** takes the students on a mission to a village.
Their destination is a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins,
which stretch along the North African coast.
A rash of sleep disturbances was recently reported by the tribes,
and **[Professor Birchwell][]** was sent to investigate and diagnose it.
They blow a tire along the way, and have to continue on foot.
They are ambushed by a different tribe,
each member of which wears a strange necklace.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** kills a tribesman, and takes his necklace.
The students are asked to carry the symbol he takes from the body,
and the expedition continues on ahead.
