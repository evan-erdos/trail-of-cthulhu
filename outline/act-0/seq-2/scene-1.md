### Scene 1 : *Writings on the Wall* ###

Deciding that there's nothing left for them, the `Players` leave the lab.
Now that they have time, they pore over **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL**'s notebook.
It's slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.
They can:
- study at what's left of the lab
- go the ruins, and talk to the tribes
- look around in a nearby town for clues


#### Clues ####
- The professor wasn't interested in these costal tribes to cure them
- He learned that they were worshipping `Hastur` & `Cthulhu`
- Further examination of his notebook reveals a `Tendril-Like Glyph`.
- the professor is no longer trying to save the world
- he's lost his mind so severely that he's working with the Soviets now
