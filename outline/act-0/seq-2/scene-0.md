### Scene 0 : *Diplomacy with Necromancers* ###

If the `Players` go to town or back to the ruins, they learn of a new ritual.
When they investigate it, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around a bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be sacrificed.
They are told that if they perform his *coup de gr√¢ce*,
then they'll be in good standing with the chief,
and must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.
