Ilya Zolnerowich
----------------

### Role ###

Ilya Zolnerwich is the chief commander of a large swath of Red Army forces south of Cairo.
His underlings have never seen him smile, not once.
In the presence of all, even Joseph Stalin himself, Ilya is almost completely silent,
choosing to communicate his thoughts only through pen and paper.
He has no family; all of them were lost in either the Russian Revolution or Stalin’s purges,
and rumor has it that he even turned his own mother over to the KGB.
His father died when he was very young:
he had collapsed in the basement of the family’s summer home,
his skin swollen and bursting at the seams.
He had shot himself.
Ilya was the one who found the body,
and hasn’t spoken a word since.

### Common Knowledge ###

Ilya was able to study psychology at Saint Petersburg State University with the help of his grandfather,
who was a professor of mathematics, and who also provided housing for him,
his mother and two siblings after his father died.
During the Russian Revolution, a group of three Bolsheviks raided his grandather’s apartment,
killing the professor and discovering the rest of the family holed up in a bathroom.
Only one made it out alive, screaming that a young man had
"stared his friends to death."
This caught the eye of the Cheka,
a newly formed security organization that used Ilya’s uncanny profiling abilities to catch enemies of the budding Soviet state.

### Wants ###

All Ilya ever seems to be interested in is his personal collection of Egyptian artifacts,
all of which bear the image of the same shrouded figure, the same scratched out cartouche.
Almost every other evening, one can hear Shostakovich's Fifth Symhpony emanating from Ilya's tent;
he carries a record of the Leningrad Philharmonic's performance of it wherever he goes.

### Tools ###

His glassy eyes hide intellect beyond belief.
Ilya is a skilled behavioural analyst and lingiust,
and he is rumored to be able to gaze into (and even seize control of) the minds of men.

### Flaws ###

Ilya still cannot block out the image of his father lying in a pool of his own blood,
and some days, these flashbacks confine him to bed until late afternoon.
Some nights, he has terrible sleep paralysis nightmares,
which his father's corpse stands at his bedside and slowly suffocates him with a pillow,
muttering "Haaa...Haaaa..."
What's more, his frantic urge to collect more artifacts seems to supercede all semblance of self-care.
Ilya will go entire days without eating or sleeping when he feels the familiar tingle in the back of his brain that urges him to ceaselessly comb a particular part of the desert.
