Colonel Ukrit Omari
-------------------

### Wants ###

To be the most powerful man alive, having gained a taste of power and control,
he is addicted to having a higher status over other people.
In order to do this though, he realizes that information,
especially that of other people’s desire, is key to his success.

---


### Tools ###

The Colonel has a large fleet of smuggling ships at his disposal,
as well as a group of highly trained soldiers both adult and child.
He also has deep knowledge of the underworld of North Africa and its various tribes and cults.
The Colonel also greases the palms of several high ranking of cials all over eastern Europe and even knows several of their wives intimately.

---


### Flaws ###

The Colonel never talks about his past.
Rumors of his poor childhood, of his being a part of a wealthy Sheik’s harem before the mysterious disappearance of said Sheik and the appearance of the Omari estate, are whispered of.
His enrollment in the military is also held in contention as there is no documented proof of a Colonel with his name.
Many of the soldiers in his posse are ex-Unit 999 which is why people believe he was a part of it too.
He goes to great lengths to hide his past and so far while the rumors of his weakness as a child persist,
anyone who claims to have proof have only ever surfaced as lifeless bodies.

### Role ###

Colonel Ukrit Omari was a elite soldier of the Egyptian Armed Forces Unit 999.
He soon found himself presented with the opportunity to take control of the entire smuggling world in a single move,
an opportunity he did not think twice about.
With the North African Soviet Outpost needing various special materials and personnel moving between Soviet territory and Africa,
the Colonel decided to profit off of the Soviet’s fanatic endeavors to transport ammunition into Africa and artefacts out of it.
His loyalties do not lie with the Soviets, nor does money sway him.
He only desires one thing - eternal power - and his acceptance of the Soviets was to use them to gain it.

### Common Knowledge ###

Colonel Ukrit Omari is surrounded by shadows and will do anything to gain information that can deliver him more power -
whether this power manifests through wealth, weapons or fear.
His thirst for this power began with his usurping the Egyptian underworld,
followed by all smuggling operations into Northern Africa.
He is looking to expand his business into Southern Africa and got into bed with the Soviets to gain the necessary weapons and funding to do so.
He hopes to someday control the whole of Africa and claim to be its ruler before moving on to the rest of the world.
He is smart, well read and ruthless.
He looks up to Alexander the Great and Hitler as inspiration and follows in their wake,
creating his own path forged in blood.
His main sources of income are valuables, weapons,
precious stones, antiques and artifacts.
He detests the drug trade as he feels drugs soften his men who should be alert and ready.
He has no qualms however in the trade of women whom he views as a commodity equal to weapons.
He also has no second thoughts about using children as soldiers.
Men who do not pass his tests, are considered beneath him and are forced into slavery,
to toil for him without rest.
