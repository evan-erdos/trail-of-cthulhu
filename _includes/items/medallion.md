### The Tendril Medallion ###
This is a medallion, found amongst ruins in Northern Africa.
It is cold to the touch, and is shaped like a tendril of some sort.
The same symbol depicted on the Tendril-Like Glyph is etched into the front face,
and it appears to have a notch in the back, as if something could be inserted into it.
