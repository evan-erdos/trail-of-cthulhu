You've been using this old-style drafting table as a desk for as long as you've needed a desk.
It's edged with a dented but sturdy aluminum frame.
It has a hefty steel pivot, its arc stretching 135Â° or more.
Four triangularly trussed legs extend to spherical rubber feet which match perfectly your dented floor.
