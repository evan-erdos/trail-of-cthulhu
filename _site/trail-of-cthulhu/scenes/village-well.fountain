EXT. RUINED VILLAGE, DAY

A group of STUDENTS find a VILLAGER, drowsily cranking the pulley on the village's well,
which they notice is not attached to any bucket.
He's just coiling and uncoiling the rope.

STUDENTS

VILLAGER

STUDENTS

VILLAGER
The ocean... th... it's th... the wind.

STUDENTS
Ok, so, how much water do you drink, usually?

VILLAGER
...the... the sun isn't hotter, but we are still thirsty.

STUDENTS
Are you thirsty at night, too?

VILLAGER
Yes, people are... thirsty, all... all the time thirsty...
