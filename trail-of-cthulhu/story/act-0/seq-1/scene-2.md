If the **[Players][]** confront **[Professor Birchwell][]** about what he did,
he's going to do everything he can to not explain it.[^0]

> We didn't find any evidence of trypanosomiasis in the lab, professor, what are you doing?

**[Professor Birchwell][]** erupts with anger towards the **[Players][]**,
almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets, and his research.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go, with a firm warning:

> Do not pursue this, you know nothing of what's at stake.


The **[Players][]** must now decide whether to investigate the other tribe,
or the Soviet troops they saw the professor with.

[^0]: He's also going to try to determine if it was the **[Players][]** he saw in the woods.
