The **[Players][]** decide to carry out the ritual.
A player wields the *Ceremonial Knife*, and approaches the altar.
The **High Acolyte** presides over the bloody altar,
and looks quite pleased with what's about to happen.
The **Sacrificial Student** lies comatose on the altar,
eyes wide open, but completely unresponsive to his surroundings.

[#]: # (guard down => REASSURANCE > 2)

If the **[Players][]** are able to keep their heads,
then the **High Acolyte** will trust them, and let his guard down.
If he doesn't believe they're genuine, he will keep his distance,
and the **[Players][]** will have no opportunity to strike him.

As the player brings the *Ceremonial Knife* down,
the **Sacrificial Student** begins to say their name.
His voice trails off after his heart is perforated by the knife.

Satisfied with their work, the **High Acolyte** tells them about a tribesman,
who claims to be able to communicate with gods.

> He told me of a sacred dream realm, larger than anyplace on earth,
> which was watched over by a golden disc.[^0]
> He told me of its wonder, how it filled the sky with wisps of gold.
> You will find this dreamer, he can achieve your awakening.

The **[Players][]** set off to find him.


[^0]: This is a dream representation of the *[Tendril Medallion][]*.
