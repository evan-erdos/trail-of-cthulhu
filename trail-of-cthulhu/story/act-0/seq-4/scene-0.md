They return to the Lab, which has been rebuilt slightly since the fire.
The **[Players][]** are given some *[medical supplies][]*,
both for the injuries they sustained at the ruins,
and for the wounds they expect to have in the future.
They clean themselves up, and they learn that **[Professor Birchwell][]** is missing.
Nobody has seen him since the fire.
They return to the ruins and the village to look for him.
When they arrive at the village, it looks like a warzone.
There are bullet holes everywhere, and villagers are bleeding out in the streets.

Among the wounded they find the girl they saw approach the professor in lecture.
Assuming she knows what happened to him, they interrogate her.
She doesn't know, but is willing to help them if they bandage her wounds.

The **[Players][]** learn that she is **[Dolya Petrovna][]**,
a Russian Journalist working for a Soviet media machine.
She reveals that the Soviets were the ones who destroyed the village,
and that they have a hidden Observatory, deep in the jungle.

Her wounds are not extensive, and she no longer wishes to serve the Soviets.

(At this point, **[Dolya][]** joins the party.)

They wait until evening, and then set out to find the Observatory.
