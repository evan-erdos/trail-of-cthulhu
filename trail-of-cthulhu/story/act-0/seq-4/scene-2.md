Having found a way in, the **[Players][]** begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.
The instructions describe, in explicit detail,
how to sync the Observatory's telescope with a moving object.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object[^0] through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

[^0]: Sputnik was broadcasting small amounts of information up to a month after launch.
