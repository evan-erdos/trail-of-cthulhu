The **[Players][]** set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
It's muggy, there's bugs everywhere, and **[Dolya][]**'s wounds still haven't healed.

After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.

This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the **[Players][]** flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

**[Dolya][]**'s leg is still wounded, and she can't move very quickly.
She's taken by the Soviets, who drive off in a different direction.

The **[Players][]** follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

They lie in wait until the Soviets leave, and then enter the Observatory.
