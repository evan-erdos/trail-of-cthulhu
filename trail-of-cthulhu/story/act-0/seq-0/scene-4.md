On the way back to the laboratory, the **[Players][]** walk past their broken-down jeep.
Careful examination reveals that it's damaged in places it wasn't before.[^0]
As the expedition continues to the laboratory, they hear strange things in the woods.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** instructs them to ignore it, and they arrive back at the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.[^1]


[^0]: Closer examination reveals bullet holes, which would implicate Soviets, not tribesmen.
[^1]: There are no matches because they're not sick, they're just being altered by Cthulhu.
[^2]: He knows what's going on, but won't tell the **[Players][]**.
