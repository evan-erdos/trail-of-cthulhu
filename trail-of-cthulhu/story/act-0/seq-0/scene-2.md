When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.
Nearly everyone appears to be sleep deprived[^0], and some even have physical wounds.

**[Professor Birchwell][]** delegates assignments to the group.
The **[Players][]** are to question the more salient locals,
to determine what they think the cause of their sickness is.
They are also tasked with finding the village leader, and getting his opinion.

After this, **[Professor Birchwell][]** wanders off into the village[^1].
If the **[Players][]** attempt to trail him, they lose sight of him in the crowd.

	<p class="action">
	A group of STUDENTS find a STOREKEEPER who is obsessively trying to clean his shop.
	He looks like he's being flung around the room by some external force.
	His movements are sloppy, he looks tired, but his eyes are wide open.
	He repeatedly wets a rag with muddy water, and wipes down the entire counter,
	leaving chunks of dirt and grime after each pass.

Given that water-borne illness is quite common,
the **[Players][]** may decide to visit the well.

	<p class="action">A group of STUDENTS find a VILLAGER, drowsily cranking the pulley on the village's well,

They have similar encounters with villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever learned about.


[^0]: The sleep issues are being caused by the village's proximity to the ocean.
[^1]: **[Professor Birchwell][]** is off talking with **[Ilya Zolnerowich][]**.
[^2]: This is strange, as everyone in the village appears to be malnourished.
[^3]: Being near the ocean means there's probably a constant 10 knot wind.
[^4]: If there's enough wind, bugs can't fly well enough to land on people and bite them.
[^5]: It hasn't been particularly hot, and they seem to have no shortage of water or shade.
