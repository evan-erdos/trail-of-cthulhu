Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".[^0]
He goes on to claim that this other tribe has caused the tides to change,
and that they wander into the village at night, and put ants in his food.[^2]
If the **[Players][]** press him, he reveals that his only son was taken.
His son disappeared without warning, a month before the village began to have problems.[^3]
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.
The **[Players][]** gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.


[^0]: The "demon" is Hastur, and the "demon worshippers" are trying to summon him.
[^1]: The uniformed men are Soviet troops who have taken an interest in the tribe.
[^2]: His hatred for this other tribe has clouded his judgement.
[^3]: This doesn't fit the pattern because the chief's son left on his own accord.
