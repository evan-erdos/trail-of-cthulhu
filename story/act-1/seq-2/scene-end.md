INT. OLD BUNKER HOLDING FACILITY - NIGHT

It seems a miracle that nobody was injured.
The BASEMENT seems to have collapsed, but completely in one piece as if it were cut around the edges.
Half of the basement is filled with holding cells, the other is a spiral staircase.
The CELL on the far right is still locked.
~~~

Using locksmith, The PCs can unlock the CELL.

~~~
INT. HOLDING FACILITY CELL - NIGHT

The Holding cell is empty.
Scuff marks on the ground leading out show a struggle at one point.
The center wall has little bits of clay on the ground.
~~~


Using Geology, or Architecture, PCs find that the wall is temporary, or part of it is.
Inside of it is a small DOLL.
It is made of human hair, pieces of cloth, and toenails.
The DOLL looks like child’s toy.

~~~
INT. OLD BUNKER DUNGEON - NIGHT

Using Evidence Collection, or History. The PCs become aware that this was once used to hide slaves for transportation long after the slave trade was abolished.
The walls have been weathered by years of fingernails digging into the.
Their is a pungent smell and a few inches of dried what appears to be mud on the floor.
So much of it that the ground almost looks like dirt apart from two steps coming from the ground.
The steps lead up to a second set of rooms, two on each side.
The doors guarding them have long since deteriorated.

In one of the rooms is a skeleton of a child.
~~~

The PCs must solve a mystery to reunite the child’s body with the Doll made by her mother.

INT. OLD BUNKER - NIGHT

Making the way back up to the top floor, the bunker is still empty.
A strange ooze seems to be on the floor making it very slippery.
It’s trail leads out of the top by the cannons,
and appears to head down the cliffside into the ocean.
~~~



Using their Firearms, the PCs aim the CANNON at the SOVIET CAMP and fire it.
The cannon ball hits one of the guard towers shattering its foundation.
A screaming gunner plunges to his death as spotlights train towards the OLD BUNKER.

~~~
BORST grabs everyone and slams them into the floor.
He doesn’t look very concerned about his dead comrade, but his face is grim.

BORST
We need to leave.
ILYA will send many comrades here.

BORST
(cont'd)
I know the way back to the cliff,
the SEA SHORE should be relatively unguarded after this.

EXT. SOVIET SEA SHORE - NIGHT

Using Sneak, Disguise, or Conceal(If in uniform) the PCs make their way past the beach defenses towards the SHIPYARD.
The patrol boats are far across providing additional lights on the OLD BUNKER,
as soldiers hack the vines away from the road leading troop carriers up the mountain.

Passing through the barbed wire the players reach a maze of containers leading into the SHIPYARD.
