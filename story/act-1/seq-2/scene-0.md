EXT. SOVIET CAMP NORTH CLIFF, DAWN

The PCs see ILYA talking to OMARI while waving the JOURNAL around.
ILYA is issuing orders to men around him getting frustrated.
The men look uneasy clearly intimidated by the furious ILYA.
BORST tells the PCs that this camp is where ILYA brings his relics to be sorted and shipped back to RUSSIA.
BORST explains that these goods are sold to auction houses around RUSSIA to the highest bidder.
~~~


Using Assess Honesty, the PCs are told that some of the artifacts are taken to military engineers that report directly to STALIN.
BORST admits that he isn’t sure what STALIN plans to use the artifacts for.
Using the BINOCULARS, while Looking over the cliff the PCs can tell that ILYA wants OMARI to start shipping things now.

~~~
ILYA points to his watch then the crates sitting around him shaking his fist.
However, OMARI just shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders.

BORST
He refuses because he wants a military escort if he is entering Russian waters.

ILYA walks into the camp’s MEDICAL WING, slamming the stainless steel doors behind him.
The PCs see him walk up the stairs through a window and go into a doorway.
Shortly after the lights flicker and cries can be heard faintly.
A few minutes pass and ILYA appears in the window of the complex.

BORST
(whispering, as if ILYA can hear him)
That’s his quarters.

Through the window the PCs see him take the JOURNAL out of his coat and place it on a side table.
ILYA then proceeds to go towards his wardrobe,
pull out a smock of some sort, then leave the PCs view.

On the other end of the SOVIET CAMP is the SHIPYARD.
Here, unarmed African children struggle to carry boxes onto a docked boat.
Several Soviets stand watch, as do a few African women with whips.
The women crack the whips over the children’s heads to keep them moving.

BORST
(pointing at the women)
Those are the Mothers.
They are the feared backbone of OMARI’s child army.
If a child is too slow, or they begin to argue,
the MOTHERS are quick to react violently.

The PCs notice a ROAD down from the cliff leading towards the SOVIET CAMP.
There also is a seaside entrance that leads to the SOVIET BASE SHIPYARD.
On the opposite side of the base lays an OLD BUNKER.
The road seems open and barren.
From afar you can see several soldiers guarding a gatehouse.
Two towers armed with RPK Light Machine guns (1959) keep a vigilant eye on the road.
Going that direction would be suicide without causing some sort of diversion.
Seaside: The oceanfront is relatively barren.
A few patrol boats circle the bay, but are far out enough that you might be able to slip by at night.
Some barb wire litters the beach making a quick escape or attack impossible without a vehicle.

BORST tells them that the OLD BUNKER was once used as a slaving site.
He says that some of his comrades claim to have found tunnels underneath it that slaves dug centuries ago in desperation to escape.
