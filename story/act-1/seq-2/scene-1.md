EXT. OLD BUNKER - DAY

After a trek around the encampment, the PCs approach the OLD BUNKER.
The path to it is overgrown from behind.
Though it is clear that at one time this was a well traveled road that had been paved with stone.
The outside of the bunker has a slit for cannons on the side,
but a cliff face that makes it impossible to scale.
A SOVIET FLAG billows in the wind about 6 ft. off the floor on a makeshift flagpole.
The entrance to the bunker has a new door on it.
It has a sticky resin on it that looks very flammable,
but there is no indication of a keyhole or lock mechanism.
In the corner next to the bunker is the remnants of a PAST CAMPFIRE.
A PILE OF BONES lay amassed in the corner.
~~~

The PCs have several choices:

[#]: [#](EXT. PILE OF BONES - DAY)

Using Forensics, or Evidence Collection,
or Cryptography PCs will discover that the bones are not human- but bull bones.
Amidst the bull bones are pieces of CHAIN.
Pulling on the end reveals one very large chain.
It appears to be very sturdy and strangely has almost no wear.
Though it appears there might be some strange layout of the bones.
The PCs take the CHAIN and add it to their inventory.
Using Archaeology it looks as if the bulls were not beaten or shot to death.
But rather starved to death chained up.
Using photography, the PCs see something glint in the photograph.
Upon further inspection they realize it’s a giant EYEHOOK that was used to tie up the bulls.
Using Athletics, the players dig up these EYEHOOK and add them to their inventory.

~~~
EXT. PAST CAMPFIRE - DAY

The campfire looks as if it has been used for generations.
Deep pockets of ash that reach ankle height sit in a loose circle.
Around it are several stumps and EMPTY VODKA BOTTLES.
The ashes have been compacted in two lines across the middle.
Some ash trails from the campfire to what appears to be tire marks leading towards the SOUTH CLIFF.

EXT. SOUTH CLIFF - DAY

Peering over the cliff you see a HARNESS caught on a branch below.
It appears to be within reach.
Several feet below the harness a TRUCK is held suspended by several more branches.
It’s top and bed seem intact, as does the GAS TANK on it’s side.
However, the windows are all shattered most of it very rusty.
Everytime the wind shakes the TRUCK sways back and forth.
~~~


Using Craft, the PCs can combine the EYEHOOK, the CHAIN,
and the HARNESS to scale the cliff and inspect the TRUCK.

~~~
EXT. SOUTH CLIFF TRUCK - DAY

The TRUCK stays suspended in air, and is far too fragile to risk entering.
A decomposing hand hanging through the front windshield is clutching a GOLD LIGHTER.
A firm kick to the GAS TANK makes a sloshing sound.
Clearly gasoline is still inside, and it remains almost completely full.

Using Craft, the PCs must fill the EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE with the GAS TANK,
then insert the SOVIET FLAG to create a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL.
Up to 3 of these can be crafted depending on how many points the PCs want to spend.
With this they can burn down the door.
Otherwise they can simply pour gasoline on the door and burn it.
