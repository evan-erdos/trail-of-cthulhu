INT. OLD BUNKER - DAY

The inside of the OLD BUNKER is strangely cold and damp.
It is empty except for the cannons pointed towards the SOVIET BASE, and a pile of 4 CANNONBALLS.
There is no keg of POWDER to use them.
A modern carpet bears witness to it all placed in the center of the room.
Right against the wall where the PCs entered is a wooden box filled with SOVIET UNIFORMS.

Carpet: Further inspection reveals the carpet covering a trapdoor leading to the basement.

INT. OLD BUNKER BASEMENT - DAY

The basement is filled with crushed pieces of wood and shackles.
One table looks like it has been there since the bunker’s construction.
Torches line the walls revealing a man sleeping peacefully in the center of the room.
He wears tattered clothes reminiscent of some sort of sailor.
He appears to be of Dutch or British descent.
In his hand is a TABLET with a Bull Sigil.

When the PCs approach him the room begins to spin and a guttural hissing sound seems to surround them on all sides.

When they wake up they are placed in a circle around the man in the middle.
His clothing looks the same, but instead of skin only a skeleton remains.
It appears to be very old and not a speck of flesh remains.
Players take a Sanity check.
Strangely, the floor around the skeleton has written in blood the word ‘AWAKEN’.
Upstairs a rattling is heard, and the trap door shuts violently.

Upon waking up the PCs find that they are no longer in the OLD BUNKER BASEMENT,
but now some sort of a HOLDING FACILITY.
