title:  Slaves of the Past
---


The players see Ilya talking to Omari while waving the journal around.
He is issuing orders to men around him getting frustrated.
Borst tells us that he wants Omari to start shipping things now.
However, Omari refuses because he wants a military escort if he is entering Russian waters.
Ilya walks into his quarters and through a window the PCs see him put the journal down.

Omari has left the shipyard and several workers are moving valuable artifacts around the camp.
The PCs have to create a distraction so that they can get the guards away from the doorway to Ilya’s quarters.
Overhearing a conversation they decide that obstructing the supply chain will take heat away from them,
and cause Ilya problems allowing them to escape with the journal.
Through either planting explosives, stealing guard uniforms and altering orders etc.
The PCs cause a disturbance.
When they do a Omari runs out of the medical facility.
The players see soldiers dragging the professor off.

The PCs sneak through the facility. They see Birchwell talking to Ilya.
They steal Ilya’s keys and attempt to enter his quarters.
They are confronted by a guard outside.
Through questioning they find out that Ilya has been unable to get inside the cave and it has put him in a terrible mood.

The party grabs the journal.
They also see Dolya chained to a metal radiator on the corner of the room, unable to escape.
Questioning her and then convincing her to join the party,
she tells them that they must first go into her room and get an artifact she took out of Ilya’s pocket...
half a Medallion the players leave the room.

PCs can search around and learn more about Dolya and her intentions.
Find the Medallion, and return to Ilya’s Quarters.

The players release Dolya and leave the building.
