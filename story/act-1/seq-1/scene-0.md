EXT. DESERT - DAY

The party follows Borst towards the coordinates they hear about on the radio,
but are caught in a sandstorm that blinds them.
The sandstorm is vicious and prevents their radio from picking up any frequency.
As if by some sort of interference, the sandstorm dissipates only to the east,
revealing a rock structure with palms outside of it.
Heading towards the palm trees the PCs hear the sound of water,
and are drawn into a cavern with a hidden waterfall oasis.
~~~

Approaching the cave the PCs notice strange ruts and marks in the sand,
the markings don’t seem to react to the winds of the violent sandstorm.
In the ruts are golden petrified SCARABS, upon trying to touch the SCARABS they turn to sand.

~~~
INT. OASIS CAVERN - DAY

The CAVERN looks hospitable.
Bones sit in a fire pit against the wall.
The CAVERN slopes towards a narrow exit and water can be heard from the other side.
The ceiling of the CAVERN is dotted with overlapping holes that protect from the elements,
but allow substantial light shafts providing plenty of natural light.
One of the light shafts reflects off something in the far corner.
~~~

Further exploring the reflection the PCs find a pair of Soviet BINOCULARS.

Using Forensics, Evidence Collection, or Archaeology,
the PCs discover that the smoke damage above the fire pit shows signs of heavy use.
Someone must be living here or was for a long time.
The bones are that of small game, probably hunted for their meat and eaten for survival.

~~~
INT. OASIS - DAY

The CAVERN opens up into a beautiful OASIS.
Inside ancient carvings of different colored rock overlook a steaming bubbling POOL about waist deep.
One in particular, a mouth or beak with a worn oval head has an opening that hangs out over the POOL.
The water is clean and fresh. Seven fruit trees grow around the pool in various areas around the room, two are very close together.
~~~


At the bottom of the POOL something gleams in the sun, it is gold.
The water is too hot to touch and causes severe burns Health -2, if a player does so.
The bubbles spray hot water in every direction stopping anyone from getting too close.

Using Biology, the PCs see that the fruits growing are more relatable to fungi.
This means that there must be some sort of decomposition going on underneath the sand.

A figure approaches from behind in the shadows, and you recognize him as the SHAMAN.

The SHAMAN seems unsettled by your sudden appearance,
as if he had just been woken up from a deep sleep.
He comes towards you with a look of anger.
He proceeds to tell you that this land is cursed, and that they should leave immediately.

Using Reassurance, the PCs convince him that they will leave soon.
Yet must rest until the sandstorm outside subsides.
The SHAMAN looks upset but doesn’t push them out.

Using Assess Honesty, The SHAMAN will admit that he has been here for sometime guarding this place.
He says that his dreams took him here.
Something about this place scares him, and that he can only find it when sleepwalking.
He tells the PCs that they are the first people he has ever seen here.

Using Architecture, Art History, Anthropology or Archaeology,
the PCs are able to distinguish this as a place of worship.
The figurines carved into the walls remain uncertain, it looks as if they were weathered away.
Based on the calm climate and protection, you can only assume that this was an act of vandalism.
It is also clear that several areas of the rock have been moved into place, and are not carved into the cliffside.
Using Athletics, The PCs can move these rocks out of the way exposing a hidden entrance into the DEEP OASIS.
Doing so will cause the SHAMAN to fly into a fit of rage, attacking the PCs with abandon.
