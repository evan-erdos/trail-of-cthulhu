INT. DEEP OASIS - DAY

Here the PCs must solve a puzzle to get the water back on. This water will cool off the POOL.

PCs get the MAGNET.
~~~

~~~
EXT. OASIS - NIGHT

After exiting the DEEP OASIS the SHAMAN’S body is gone.
Where it was another tree has grown.
A ninth in the group around the POOL.

Water gushes out from the beak of whatever oval face was once carved into the cliff,
it cascades into the POOl.
The water of the POOL is no longer bubbling or steaming.
~~~


The first player who tries to grab it is pulled into the oasis by a tentacle,
but when they surface can’t see anything in the POOL.
In their hands is a piece of the MEDALLION. Take a Sanity check.

Outside the sandstorm dies out.

~~~
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
After leaving the cave a solid slab of rock closes behind them.
Occult writing in glowing red surface on the rocks.
~~~

Using Photography, PCs can capture the writing seeing that it is a POEM in a foreign language.

With the interference from the sandstorm gone, Radio chatter resumes.
PCs hear Birchwell come up in conversation, and Borst makes out that the Professor is in the background.

The PCs head to the SOVIET CAMP, Borst says he will lead the PCs to where Birchwell is being held.
He says he knows a secret way in, and will explain when they arrive.
