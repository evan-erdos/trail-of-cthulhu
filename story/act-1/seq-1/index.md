The party follows the coordinates towards the coordinates they hear about on the radio but are caught in a sandstorm that blinds them.
They hear the sound of water and are drawn into a cavern with a hidden waterfall oasis.

PCs see a glimmer in the water. Upon approaching it a figure comes out of the shadows.
It’s the shaman from the tribes.
He curses the PCs for entering a cave after they were told not to.
He warns them to leave immediately.
The players kill him and then go explore the pool of water.
They find have of an ancient medallion. The first player who tries to grab it is pulled into the oasis by a tentacle,
but when he surfaces can’t see anything.
The sandstorm dies out.

After leaving the cave a solid slab of rock closes behind them.
Revealing a keyhole and occult writing.
Radio chatter catches the voice of the Professor in the background.
The PCs head to the Soviet Base, as a reluctant Borst joins them.
