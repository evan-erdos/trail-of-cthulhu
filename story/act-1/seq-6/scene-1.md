INT. CAVE LOWER LEVEL - DAWN

The sound of the destroyed statues causes the russians to attack from above and enter the cave.
There entrance through the ceiling causes the mask to fall and drop down.
ILYA gets the mask and puts it on transforming himself as yellow mist fills the room.
The mist kills the soldiers combining them into a giant flesh monster.
The players fight the monster killing it, but causing the ceiling to collapse.
They escape through a hidden chamber underneath the throne.

INT. CAVE HIDDEN CHAMBER - DAWN

The hidden chamber has a timeline of Hastur that shows even into the future.
It also has references to an ancient god named CTHULHU.
The party analyzes this and exits into the chamber where ILYA found the first half of the MEDALLION and left BORST for dead.

EXT. RUINS - DAY

The party regroups and decides how they are going to follow ILYA and get the MASK and their professor back.
