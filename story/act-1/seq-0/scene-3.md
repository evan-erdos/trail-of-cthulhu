EXT. DUNES - DAY

AMBALO and five of his best warriors stand around the truck,
they are well equipped and appear healthy and strong.
AMBALO carries his ceremonial spear.
A Jagged weapon made with the sharpened teeth of the wild beasts he has slain.
On his waist is a TT-3 Tokarev 7.62mm automatic pistol (1933).
Two soldiers are armed with Soviet Mosin Nagant M10 7.62mm combat carbines.
Three have machetes and shields.

AMBALO approaches you with urgency in his voice.

AMBALO
Drop your weapons. We are not here for you.
Help us, we must act quickly, it will be too late.

He motions to his men and points at the truck.

AMBALO
Once one has felt his touch,
it is no longer in our power to save them.

From inside the MEDICAL TRUCK a cry can be heard from the student.

STUDENT
Help me! Oh please… I need you...

Putrid yellow fluid drips through the wall and slides onto the tires causing them to light.

AMBALO
(yelling at the STUDENTS)
We need your help, the sand is thick here.
Move the truck into the pit! Only fire can cleanse these demons!
~~~


PC’s have several choices here:

Using Reassurance they can explain that the person needs help.
This will cause Ambalo to reprimand them. He will order them to move the truck.
If they refuse he will threaten their lives.
Before anything can done the MEDICAL TRUCK will detonate causing shrapnel to fill the air.
One of the warriors holding a machete is struck in the neck by the bumper,
his head is almost decapitated but hangs on just enough to face up while his chest lays against the sand.
PCs will do a Health check -1 to assess if the shrapnel hit them.
From the fire and smoldering metal emerges the WRETCHED BARNACLE.

Using Athletics all the PCs can help the soldiers push the truck into the fire.
The truck slides into the Pit and screams can be heard from the student inside.
From the fire a tentacle reaches out and grabs one of the warriors holding a machete by the leg dragging him down into the flaming pit.
The players take a stability check as the warrior struggles for his life.
In desperation Ambalo picks up the warrior’s dropped machete and lunges at the tentacle.
Severing it, the tentacle retreats back into the flames.
The warrior desperately tries to climb out of the pit, but is stopped halfway by a second tentacle that wraps around his ankle.
Ambalo looks ready to attack when a third tentacle lurches from the fiery abyss, swatting Ambalo to the floor.
It travels through the air and grips the other ankle,
lifting the warrior into the air and pulling him apart by the legs.
Everyone pulls back on their guard. Inhuman shrieks fill the air for a few moments, then the pit falls quite.
The color of the smoke turns a sickly yellow.

Using Firearms the PCs can use their flare gun to fire into the back of the MEDICAL TRUCK.
The impact will cause the student to yell and scream before flames engulf them.  
The MEDICAL TRUCK will detonate causing shrapnel to fill the air.
One of the warriors holding a machete is struck in the neck by the bumper,
his head is almost decapitated but hangs on just enough to face up while his chest lays against the sand.
PCs will do a Health check -1 to assess if the shrapnel hit them.
From the fire and smoldering metal emerges the (BURNING) WRETCHED BARNACLE.

Using Scuffle the players can attempt to fight with the natives.
If doing so Ambalo will attack first, then his warriors.
Before the players have a chance to rebuttal the MEDICAL TRUCK will detonate causing shrapnel to fill the air.
One of the warriors holding a machete is struck in the neck by the bumper,
his head is almost decapitated but hangs on just enough to face up while his chest lays against the sand.
PCs will do a Health check -1 to assess if the shrapnel hit them.
From the fire and smoldering metal emerges the WRETCHED BARNACLE.

[NOTE: The party’s attacks will also be supplemented by those of AMBALO and his warriors. All of their weapons are +0 except for AMBALOS ceremonial spear which is +1]

After defeating the WRETCHED BARNACLE the PCs are approached by AMBALO.
He asks them what brought them to this MEDICAL TRUCK.
After explaining the wound that BORST has suffered,
AMBALO informs them that he knows of a PURPLE ROOT that when combined with some of the herbs he knows will heal the wound.
The problem is that the PURPLE ROOT grows in a certain type of extremely hard soil,
a soil that the Soviets have begun building a RADIO TOWER on.
Ambalo proceeds to tell the PCs that the tower isn’t finished yet,
so there is a chance that the PURPLE ROOT is growing in that area still.
AMBALO asks that you come back to his tribe and head out to the RADIO TOWER in the morning after resting.
