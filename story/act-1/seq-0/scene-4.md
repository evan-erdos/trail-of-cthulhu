EXT. AMBALO’S TRIBE - NIGHT

Entering the village you notice that everyone is very sad.
AMBALO explains that tomorrow he will explain more details about the PURPLE ROOT and the MEDICINAL TONIC it will create.
The people of the tribe are distraught by the loss of one of their best warriors.
To honor him they have a ritualistic funeral and feast.
Many strange foods are passed around including; a calf, chickens, goat, and fish.
There an intricate salad of herbs you have never seen before.
The feast revitalizes the PCs giving them +2 Health and +1 Stability.
The PCs notice that there is no water being served,
and many people are drinking the blood of the slaughtered animals or goat milk.
The tribe’s SHAMAN also passes around a broth that smells very pungent.
Those who drink it become jovial and dance in memory of their fallen tribesman.
If the PCs decide to drink the broth -1 Sanity,
but they can choose to put a single point on any Interpersonal Ability.
~~~

Have the PCs explain how they spend the night.

INT. AMBALO’S HUT - MORNING

The PCs groggily shuffle into AMBALO’S HUT in the morning to meet with him.
Instead of seeing him the PCs are greeted by his 19 year-old daughter SIMBALA.
She is an assertive but playful woman who has more piercings than any of you have seen.
She smiles and welcomes you, promising that her father will be out of bed soon.
She is young and easily manipulated,
and many tribesman boast of having coerced her into spending the night with them.
AMBALO doesn’t seem to mind so long as they respect her.
~~~



The PCs can use this as a chance to ask SIMBALA some questions about the tribe and surrounding region,
the relationship between the tribe and the russians, and about the politics of the tribe.
Region: Simbala notes that the tribe has been around for generations.
It is fed by the local jungle herbs that feed the same livestock.
It also is sustained by fishing.

Relationship with Russians:
SIMBALA says that the tribe is angry at the Soviets.
She explains that Soviet construction of the RADIO TOWER has damaged the water supply and many have become sick from drinking the water.
She says that it’s so bad they don’t drink water anymore,
and must travel a vast difference to get water for their livestock.

Politics of the Tribe:
SIMBALA says that people have been worried about their SHAMAN.
She says he disappears sometimes for several nights at a time, sometimes speaking in tongue.
Apparently he sleeps very little and is becoming weak.


At last AMBALO appears carrying a MAP of the local area.
He shows you where the Soviets have begun their construction of the RADIO TOWER,
and the ridge behind it where the PURPLE ROOT grows.
AMBALO explains that their SHAMAN will make the MEDICINAL TONIC using 41 different herbs.
That it is no easy task, but that he will help the PCs if they help his tribe.
He explains that the RADIO TOWER isn’t completed,
but that already it is damaging the ecosystem his people consider their historic memory.
AMBALO continues to tell you that he fears Soviet expansion will one day cut down the jungles.
If you can halt the production of the RADIO TOWER, he will give you the MEDICINAL TONIC.

To win their favor the PCs will have to destroy invasive Soviet Radio Equipment.
