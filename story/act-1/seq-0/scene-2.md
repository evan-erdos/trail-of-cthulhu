Inside a student you have never seen is sitting in the corner of the truck.
She hugs her knees to her chest rocking back and forth.

INT. SOVIET MEDICAL TRUCK - DAY

The truck is clean and filled with supplies.
It is evident that the soviets haven’t used any of the supplies to heal the students.
There are BANDAGES and ANTIBACTERIALS on the shelves.
As the PCs get closer to the STUDENT, they see that her clothes are soaking wet,
and she is covered with sea foam and chunks of flesh.
She is whimpering and shaking despite the hot stuffy interior of the truck.
The room smells fetid, a different more vulgar smell than the burning bodies.

The student raises her face, and everyone must take a Stability check.
The bottom half of her face is raw with the jawbone protruding through the little muscle left.
Her tongue is intact but is covered with barnacles.
Her eyes on the other hand are nowhere to be seen.
Instead two strange sea cucumbers grow from her eye sockets,
they have long antennas which whisk around the air feeling around the walls and floor.

INT. SOVIET MEDICAL TRUCK - DAY

When the PCs approach her she raises her head uttering in guttural sounds,

STUDENT
ya vulgtlagln -nyth n'ghft...

The PC’s can use Occult, Cthulhu Mythos, or Languages to interpret her words as “I pray to servant of Darkness”.

The girl tries to get up, but her body has rusted to the metal floor of the MEDICAL TRUCK.
Blood mixes with seawater as the seams of her skin stay cemented to the floor but tears from soft muscle underneath.
She lets out a scream, and projectile vomits a steaming yellow liquid.
The liquid sprays on the walls of the MEDICAL TRUCK, the BANDAGES and ANTIBACTERIALS.
It instantly dissolves them into a black bubbling tar.
Drips of the liquid spill onto her clothes burning them away, scarring her flesh,
and exposing the soft tissue underneath. The medical supplies are ruined.

STUDENT
(moaning)
Please, help me.. Save me.

Strange movements begin to occur underneath her skin as if bugs are crawling beneath the flesh trying to burst out.

She starts spitting steaming yellow liquid randomly, and it gets dangerously close to the PCs.

Many area of the trucks have already disintegrated giving it the appearance of a skeleton.
Through the holes you see figures with spears moving outside.
