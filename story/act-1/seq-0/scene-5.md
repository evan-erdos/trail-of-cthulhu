EXT. SOVIET RADIO TOWER - NIGHT

Upon entering the RADIO TOWER it becomes evident that the Soviets are building much more than just one tower.
Trucks sit filled with earth insinuating plans to terraform.
Piles of steel and wire lay in bins ready to be implemented.
A SHED sits in the corner of the compound.
The base of the tower seems to be working,
a light flashes on the top as a rotating blade cuts through the night air.
The area is relatively quiet besides the one generator powering the rig.

Parked in the center is a massive EARTH HAULER that has been outfitted with a diamond drill.
The cab is locked, but through the window you can see a set of pickaxes and a .600 Elephant Rifle.

INT. RADIO TOWER SHED - NIGHT

Generators are lined up to provide power, with barrels of gasoline to power them.

INT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT

The inside of the tower is clearly finished.
Computer monitors flicker with soviet symbols, and advanced radio equipment.
The radios don’t seem to be working yet.
There is a PERSONAL RADIO sitting next to the sleeping TOWER GUARD.
The TOWER GUARD seems fast asleep, and unaware of the russian banter on the other side of the radio.

Using Language, the PCs hear the coordinates of a cave system in question which they mark on the map.
Using Interrogate, or Intimidation, the PCs can ask the guard questions.
Soon it becomes evident he doesn’t speak a word of english and is drunk to the point of not being able to form russian words.
Using Streetwise, the PCs can pour a drink with the TOWER GUARD.
He makes them sing a russian folk song with him called “Little Apple”.
Each PC must sing their own personal stanza iteration of the song to appease the TOWER GUARD.

[Note: This song is performed like a ditty (folk rhymed proverbs), and the words are often changed by the performer, The most common ditty: “Hey, little apple, but where are you rolling to? You will get in my mouth – and will never come out!”  Or, for example, here is a naughty version of the ditty:  “Hey, little apple, you are on a plate, My wife bores me – I’ll go find a young girl.”]
 
After singing along to the clapping TOWER GUARD,
he will give the players the EARTH MOVER KEYS.
Using the EARTH MOVER the PCs can break into the soil and dig out PURPLE ROOT.
The PCs must destroy the radio tower by using knowledge of electrical and mechanical repair.
Here they obtain a soviet RADIO that allows them to hear russian military chatter.

EXT. TRIBES - DAY

The players return to the tribe and give the SHAMAN the PURPLE ROOT.
They also tell AMBALO that they have destroyed the RADIO TOWER.
He tells them to speak more to the SHAMAN about the application of the MEDICINAL TONIC.
The SHAMAN speaks slowly as he finished mixing the medicine.
His words are slow and deliberate.
He says to apply the MEDICINAL TONIC once, and only once.
That it should be done before removing the blade from the victim.
The PCs can question the SHAMAN further about his recent behavior.
If they do the SHAMAN will lie to them saying that he has been present the whole time,
just that the tribes people have become less observant with the stress of the Soviets and disappearance of AMBALO’S son EFUA.

Using Assess Honesty, the Pcs can call him on his lie.
The SHAMAN will admit that he has been leaving the camp.
He explains that he has problems sleeping unless he is by flowing water.
He can’t sleep if he can’t hear water moving.
Even then weird dreams have been making him reckless.
The SHAMAN tells them that the russians have sent parties to their temples and ransacked them looking for information about a mask.
HE warns the PCs not to enter any of the nearby caves as they are cursed.

EXT. RUINS - DAY
The PCs make it back to BORST and give him the MEDICINAL TONIC and the Personal RADIO.
Using Medicine, the PCs apply the tonic and it seals the wound so not a single drop of blood remains on the dagger as they slowly remove it from BORST.

Thankful, BORST uses the radio to contact the soviet base.
He tells them that the soviets have used the JOURNAL to find the location of an important underground TEMPLE.
Deep inside a CAVE. Borst convinces them that ILYA will have brought BIRCHWELL to the TEMPLE,
and must have tortured him into revealing the secrets of his journal.

Feeling much better BORST says he will lead the PCs to this cave.
