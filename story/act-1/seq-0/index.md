The party has regrouped in the ruins surrounding the burned school.
They survey the land to scavenge whatever resources available.
The PCs run into Borst and he has a dagger on him.
Using the resources they heal him and find out that the Soviets have caused the fire in the school.
He needs additional healing herbs from the local tribes.

Depending on how the PCs have interacted with the tribes in Act I they will have an easier or more difficult time obtaining the herbs.
The PCs might have to trade the dagger or can convince the tribes to give them herbs.
But to win their favor they will have to destroy invasive Soviet Radio Equipment.

The PCs must destroy the radio tower by using knowledge of electrical and mechanical repair.
Here they obtain a soviet radio that allows them to hear russian military chatter.

The players return to the tribe and receive the healing herbs.
The shaman tells them that the russians have sent parties to their temples and ransacked them looking for information about a mask.
He warns the PCs not to enter any of the nearby caves as they are cursed.

The PCs make it back to Borst and give him the herbs and the radio.
Borst uses the radio to tell them that the soviets have used the journal to find the location of an important underground temple.
Deep inside a cave.
Borst convinces them that Ilya will have brought Birchwell to the temple,
and must have tortured him into revealing the secrets in the journal.
