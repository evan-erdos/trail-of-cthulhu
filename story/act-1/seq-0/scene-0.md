The party has regrouped in the ruins surrounding the burned school.
The flames of burning have subsided, but much of the contents lays smoldering.
About a mile away a pillar of black smoke smears the air.
They survey the land using to scavenge whatever resources available.[^health]

EXT. RUINS - DAY

The PCs hear moaning coming from behind a pillar.
Upon inspection they find BORST, he is injured and has a dagger wedged into his chest.
BORST calls out for his wife ADELA, before seeing the PCs... He then falls silent.

BORST
The students of Birchwell, I thought they had killed you all...
Birchwell will be pleased when I tell him.
~~~


The PCs have several options here:
PCs attempt to remove the dagger and Borst lashes out at them cursing in Russian.[^healing]
He switches over to English and tells them that this wound feels on fire,
and that if they remove the blade he will surely bleed to death.
Borst tells them to end his life, laughing about how they will surely all die in the desert.

FIRST AID NEEDS TO HEAL BUT CAUSE A WORSE THING TO HAPPEN,
MEDICINE ALSO WORKS BUT DOES SOMETHING WORSE. TOGETHER SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC.

Borst tells them that he was in charge of ‘civilizing’ the local native populations.[^question]
That STALIN has interest in the resources that the jungles on the outskirts of the desert hold.
He curses the natives, claiming that one of them plunged a knife in him when he was discussing trade agreements.
Borst will crumble and admit that he hasn’t been working with the natives.[^assess]
He speaks of his betrayal by Ilya,
and that he must make it back to his wife in Russia after exacting his revenge on Ilya.

The PCs will cause Borst to breakdown into tears.[^info]

He will tell of his soon to be baby, and his innate need to see his child born.
He curses ILYA for his betrayal, and vows vengeance.
Promising that he can help the PCs if they aid him.
If they press him, Borst will close up and begin praying in Russian.[^pray]
Tears stream down his face but he does not crack.

EXT. RUINS - DAY

BORST
(lauging in the PCs faces)
You don’t think that I’ve endured worse?
You aren’t very creative...
I guess that’s why you are just sheep studying under Birchwell. Suchas!
~~~


Further questioning Borst about Birchwell he will tell you of his involvement in the fire,
and how Birchwell has been working alongside the Soviets for some time now.
He explains this is why Birchwell took his research to Africa.
He needed to escape the U.S. Government who was aware of his Communist affiliation.
Borst claims that he knows where Birchwell is and that he can take you to him.

With a final groan, Borst tells the PCs that a Soviet MEDICAL TRUCK is stationed over the sand dune.
That the driver should still be in it, but in the back is valuable medical supplies.
If they can find ANTIBACTERIALS, then they might heal him.
He says that he can smell flesh, so therefore the MEDICAL TRUCK hasn’t left yet.

Before being able to question Borst further, he passes out.
The PCs look up and see the trail of smoke in the air.
Lines lead up the dune from the ruins of the school, some of them have blood drips dried in the sand.
The trails lead over the dune to the MEDICAL TRUCK.
