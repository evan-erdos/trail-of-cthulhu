Depending on how the PCs have interacted with the TRIBES,
they will have an easier or more difficult time obtaining the MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

Surveying the other side of the Dunes the PCs see a Soviet MEDICAL TRUCK as BORST described.
There is a soldier sitting in the front seat, but he isn’t moving.
The truck is facing a pit in the sand where the fire is.
The view of the fire is obscured by thick smoke, and the flame isn’t visible.
The back of the truck is closed, and nobody else seems around.
A rifle lays on the ground with its bolt open, it is empty.

Approaching the MEDICAL TRUCK It is visible that the soldier in the front seat is alive but not mentally present.
He is shaking violently and looking off into space mumbling to himself in a language you have never heard.
On the rearview mirror a KEYRING swings in the air.
The back of the MEDICAL TRUCK is locked.[^1]
Upon closer inspection it is apparent that the pit is full of the bodies of whatever students survived the fire.

The Soldier reacts violently if the PCs attempt to question him.

Swinging the door of the MEDICAL TRUCK quickly he knocks the PC to the floor taking a point off of Health.

EXT. DUNES - DAY

The PCs approach the truck, and find a SOLDIER in the front seat, alive but not mentally present.
He frantically gets out of the TRUCK and speaks English in a strange hoarse voice, with an unfamiliar accent.
His eyes pure white with no pupils.

SOLDIER
They took the children, it wasn’t me!
They did it-- he, he his eyes!

With that the soldier begins projectile vomiting.
Chunks of blood and bile mix with seaweed and yellow saltwater spill onto the sand.
The SOLDIER staggers and then his eyes turn completely black.
He turns and sprints to the pit leaping into the fire.

Checking the inside of the MEDICAL TRUCK players find a very 12-gauge flare pistol (1882). A 750ml of Vodka, and a broken radio.

The PCs find shells around the side of the truck.
However, the amount of shells and signs of struggle make it seem like there wasn’t enough bullets to execute all the students...
leading the PCs to believe that many must have been tossed into the fire alive.

The PCs find that the fire is composed of students, natives, and gasoline.

The back of the truck can be unlocked with the KEYRING.[^0]
