EXT. PIRATE PORT - DAY

The PORT is crawling with pirates, most of them in their early teens.
As you drive through the PORT the pirates bow to OMARI.
His face remains unchanged.
~~~


The PORT has several small watercrafts that look like they have been outfitted to raid larger ships.
One large ship sits amongst them, that OMARI explains this is his warship AMUN which is egyptian for ‘the hidden one’.
He boasts that it has never been sunk in all his years of piracy.

The PORT is built around a massive OIL TANKER,
that has been welded into the surrounding docks and landscape making it a permanent building unchallenged by the tides.
Many smaller ships have been ‘sewn’ onto this OIL TANKER in a similar fashion.
One is an antique steamboat that has been repurposed into a PRINTING PRESS.
The other is a FIREBOAT.
