The party rolls up to the cave and instantly Ilya recognizes them.
He pulls the pendant off of Dolya’s neck and searches the PCs,
taking the other half of the medallion.
Ilya’s soldier place the completed Medallion in the keyhole and a yellow gas leaks out causing serious burns, blisters and popping warts.
One soldier runs into the caves.
Ilya forces the PC into the cave after him by gunpoint.
He tells them that if they make it out alive he will let them and Birchwell leave.

The party searches for clues as to where the soldier went.
They find his arm decapitated and covered in barnacles.
They also find his gun.
After picking it up Ilya sends two soldiers after them.
Through dialogue or force the PCs deal with them and go deeper inside to find the soldier.

The soldier is inside the main chamber hiding behind a pillar.
A strange contraption lies dormant.
Using dialogue the players must coerce the dying soldier to giving them the handle to this contraption, which he is using as a temporary arm in his disillusioned state.
There are other ways to get to the bottom floor involving a giant statue puzzle.

The lower level has a pool of water that reflects a version of the sky.
It is missing the ‘cancer’ constellation.
In the next room the party finds 3 statues including a crab, a bull, and a warped version of a child suckling it’s mother’s teet.
The players use the crab statue (which fires projectiles) to destroy the other statues and gain access to a throne in the center of a void.
On the ceiling in an intricate mosaic is a mask.
