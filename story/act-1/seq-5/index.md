At the caves, **[Ilya][]** sees the **[Players][]**,
and gives them his half of the medallion,
telling them to unlock the secrets of the cave.
The Soviets then detonate the door,
and strange gas melts their faces and kills them.
**[Ilya][]** forces the **[Players][]** inside at gunpoint.
The **[Players][]** unlock the mask of Hastur.
