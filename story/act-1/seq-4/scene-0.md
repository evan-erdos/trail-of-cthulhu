EXT. SOVIET BASE SHIPYARD - DAY

OMARI pulls up in a truck and is convinced that the PCs are the reinforcements that ILYA ordered.
He beckons them to get into the truck.
The entirety of the camp soldiers, tired and angry from a fruitless search at the OLD BUNKER,
glare at the PCs forcing them into the truck.

OMARI tells them that they are headed to the CAVE which ILYA is attempting to open.
Allegedly the and more soldiers are needed to carry new goods to the DOCKS.
But first they must get supplies from his ship to help the archaeology at the CAVE.

OMARI drives the PCs from the SOVIET BASE through the jungle towards the PIRATE PORT.

EXT. DESERT GRAVEYARD - DAY

The truck comes to a halt amidst a massive ship blocking it’s path.
The ship is covered in rust and wet to the touch.
Barnacles and strange slime ooze from it’s pores.

Using the BINOCULARS: Upon closer inspection they see that the ship is the AMUN,
it’s lettering so faded and illegible it seems to be it from a different time.
A slow trail of smoke rises from the hood of the TRUCK.
OMARI tells the PCs that the truck has stalled.

Using mechanical repair, the PCs find that the FUEL PUMP is broken.
Looking behind the TRUCK a trail of gasoline mixes with the sand and treadmarks.
The TRUCK has been leaking GASOLINE.

OMARI says that the T-34 Tanks will have enough gas to syphon,
but first the PCs need to find a GAS CANISTER to hold it.
The PCs pan out and look around.

The graveyard of T-34 tanks hides some gears and engine parts OMARI can use to fix the truck.
