The truck comes to a halt amidst a massive ship blocking it’s path.
The ship is covered in rust and wet to the touch.
Barnacles and strange slime ooze from it’s pores.
Omari tells the PCs that the truck has stalled and that they need to find some parts to get it working.
The PCs pan out and look around.
Upon closer inspection they see that the ship is Omari’s but seems to be it from a different time.
The graveyard of T-34 tanks hides some gears and engine parts Omari can use to fix the truck.

Horrible rituals have been performed inside the ship.
Further exploration finds that the Captain’s Quarters are filled with the bodies of sacrificed children.
Inside they find a letter written by Omari to Ilya about a shipment.
It is dated 3 weeks in the future.
It mentions a holding cell full of lockers in the Crew’s Quarters.

Inside lockers the PCs find skeletons wearing their same attire, their bodies from another dimension.
They also find a rusty key.

After returning from the ship Omari asks them what they found.
Omari then takes the party to the cave.
