INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY

The MEDICAL LAB is empty of any humans.
The room is dark and lit by turquoise cylinders of strange fluid.
These cylinders vary in size, some holding rats and frogs,
and others entire natives floating in a dreamlike state.
Tubes hook up to them feeding them oxygen, but it is unclear what these tubes connect to.
Sophisticated hanging thermometers are connected to the cylinders monitoring the temperature of them, and the surrounding room.
On the left is an AIR CONDITIONER unit that keeps the lab temperate.
In the corner is a COAT RACK, nothing of interest is on it.
But it is quite large and would make a great hiding spot.

The tile floor is smeared with blood and quite slippery.
A trail leads to the doorway, which is fastened shut.
On the other side you can hear screaming.
~~~

Using Mechanical Repair, or Craft the PCs can sabotage the AIR CONDITIONER.

~~~
After doing so the doors will burst open and ILYA will enter the room.

ILYA
Damn these machines!
Bring him in here, now!

A soviet soldier wheels Birchwell into the room.
BIRCHWELL is tied down with straps to a vertical cage.
He can barely move and has a cloth in his mouth.
He is sweating profusely and caked with dried blood.
ILYA walks over to the AIR CONDITIONER and gives it a pound.
The machine remains dormant.

ILYA
All the resources of STALIN and I can’t get a damn thing working.
First it’s that new ELECTRONIC LOCK password,
now this confounded AIR CONDITIONER. Where is that engineer?

Reaching into his left pocket ILYA pulls out a PAPER,
he then without hesitating reaches into his right and pulls out a RADIO.

ILYA
Get me the ENGINEER...
I don’t care what the problem is, that is a direct order!


While shouting on the radio ILYA jumps up and down.
The soldier besides BIRCHWELL looks worried.
With one final jump ILYA slips on the bloody floor falling down getting blood all over his coat.
He breaks his fall with the PAPER and the RADIO.

ILYA
grebanyy suka !

The PAPER is covered in blood, as it the radio.
ILYA presses the RADIO and it fizzles and die.
In a rage ILYA throws the RADIO with all his might past the soldier and it shatters against the wall of the MEDICAL LAB.
He puts the PAPER back into his jacket pocket.

ILYA
Now I need a new RADIO and a new COAT!

Stomping towards the COAT RACK,
ILYA removes his coat and places it on the COAT RACK,
replacing it with another one.

ILYA
The ENGINEER should be here soon.
Bring BIRCHWELL with me.
If this ENGINEER can’t figure out the AIR CONDITIONER I will have him executed!

ILYA stomps into the doorway as the distressed soldier obediently follows with BIRCHWELL.

The PCs can now steal the PAPER from ILYA’S COAT.
It contains the password to the ELECTRONIC LOCK.
