Inside the CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS is a button for the AIR HORN, and a RADIO TRANSMITTER.
The RADIO TRANSMITTER seems to be somewhat broken at the moment.
Sparks fly out of the console and the voices on the other side are too garbled to be Russian or English.
Though one of the voices sound familiar.

Using Electrical Repair, The PCs can fix the RADIO TRANSMITTER and listen in on the conversation.

INT. GASOLINE BARGE CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MORNING

It instantly becomes clear that the voice is that of ILYA, and the other is BIRCHWELL.

ILYA
You’ve been most helpful Professor.
So helpful that the pain doesn’t need to continue... but I want it too!

BIRCHWELL
I’ve told you all I know.

ILYA
You’ve told me all that is in THE JOURNAL, but that’s not everything.

BIRCHWELL
You’re blind ILYA!

ILYA
Oh, professor...

Screaming ensues and static cuts the screams.

ILYA
vyklyuchit' proklyatuyu radio!

The radio cuts into silence.

Looking down into the storage it is clear that there is no room to move around.
The bottom of the BARGE is completely filled with GASOLINE BARRELS and OIL TANKS.
It is evident that these are important for the Soviet mobility in AFRICA.

The PCs can choose to craft an explosive using the OIL, GASOLINE, and ROPES.
After getting off the boat the PCs can detonate it.

The explosion will cause the Soviets to charge towards the SHIPYARD,
OMARI comes charging out of the MEDICAL WING, leaving the MEDICAL LAB unguarded.
