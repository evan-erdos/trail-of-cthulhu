EXT. SOVIET BASE SHIPYARD - DAWN

OMARI has left the shipyard, and is nowhere to be seen.
Several workers are waking up and preparing to move valuable artifacts around the camp.
They are groggy and unalert, the PCs' presence will likely not disturb them.
It’s obvious that ILYA is concerned about his specimens,
as Soviet soldiers are helping with carrying as well.
The majority of the army is still at the OLD BUNKER looking for the perpetrators who fired upon the SOVIET CAMP.

Two men walk out from behind a crate speaking in Russian.
Borst motions for the PCs to be quite as he strains his neck to listen.
The men speak about the supply chain that OMARI has built to move the artifacts around the camp.
Some sort of CONVEYOR BELT where workers can sort the artifacts,
and then distribute them appropriately.
The soldiers are hopeful that this CONVEYOR BELT will speed up their work in AFRICA.
They speak about how invested ILYA has been it it’s production.
The soldiers walk off for a smoke talking about the MOTHERS and how savage they are, making jokes about their sexuality.

The MEDICAL WING has two guards stationed out front.
They seem more vigilant than the other soldiers, and have clearly been awake for several hours.
It doesn’t seem like the PCs could get by them.

On the dock is a large GASOLINE BARGE.
It is old and has several GENERATORS on it. The crew seems non-existent.

A row of shacks line the wall.
BORST explains this is the STORAGE HOUSE where soviet supplies are transferred to feed the army.
~~~

The PCs have to create a distraction so that they can get the guards away from the doorway to the MEDICAL WING.
Overhearing a conversation they decide that obstructing the supply chain will take heat away from them,
and cause ILYA problems allowing them to escape with the journal.
Through either planting explosives, stealing guard uniforms and altering orders etc. The PCs cause a disturbance.
When they do a OMARI runs out of the medical facility.
The players see soldiers dragging the professor off.

They have several options:

~~~
EXT. SOVIET CAMP CONVEYOR BELT - MORNING

The CONVEYOR BELT appears to be on it’s way.
The track is finished and GENERATORS have been placed intermittently around the different intersections where the tread splits.
It is a feat of engineering. The wires from the GENERATORS are not connected to the CONVEYOR BELT,
instead they feed into an ELECTRICAL SHACK.

INT. ELECTRICAL SHACK - MORNING

The SHACK is surprisingly spacious on the inside,
and the floor has been dug down several feet to fit a slew of machines.
The machines have flashing lights and different levers.
It appears that this setup is in charge of more than just the large CONVEYOR BELT.
~~~


Using Electrical Engineering the PCs will deduce that this platform probably also powers the spotlights around the camp.

All the machines are linked to a POWERCORE in the center of the room. The wires leading to it have been buried deep underground and can’t be seen.

The POWERCORE looks volatile, with large lightning bolts jolting out of it scarring the surrounding sand.
Little dots of glass litter the floor, a testament to where the lightning bolts have struck.
If the PCs can somehow douse this POWERCORE with water...
they could probably ruin it and shortcircuit the system.
The PCs can come up with a way to steal it using the MAGNET.

If the PCs short circuit the POWERCORE OMARI comes charging out of the MEDICAL WING.
Leaving the MEDICAL LAB free from guards.

THE GASOLINE BARGE: The BARGE is hooked up by a thick chain to the dock. Using Stealth, or Athletics, one of the PCs can climb aboard the barge.


~~~
EXT. GASOLINE BARGE - MORNING

A boarding ramp extends from the deck that can be pushed from the boat onto the dock making it easy for the other PCs to enter.

The deck of the BARGE is relatively well kept.
No trash but a ROPE lays around, the BARGE seems to be used as an extra storage section rather than a functional watercraft.
Wires from the CAPTAIN’s QUARTERS connect to the MEDICAL LAB.
It is unclear if they provide electricity or are transmitting a signal.

There is a pile of tires towards the rear of the boat.
Several GAS CANISTERS sit beside them.

The CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS is behind a swivel door. It is unlocked.
