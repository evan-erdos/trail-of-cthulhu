Omari pulls up in a truck and is convinced that the PCs are the reinforcements that Ilya ordered.
Omari tells them that they are headed to the cave to carry new goods to the docks.
But first must get supplies from his ship.

The player characters arrive on the docks and see children hauling boxes of goods while others guard over them with weapons.
Omari calls them his children, and explains that they deserve better than the lives they have- and that he provides for them.

On the docks a child slips and drops a precious vase.
Omari flies into a fit of anger and tells the PCs they must punish this child while he secures military escort.
Omari points at his boat and tells them to take the child to the Crew's Quarters.

The child obediently leads the party into the crews quarters where several children are sitting around looking exhausted.
A guard stands at the ready eyeing the group.
The PCs must decide whether or not to beat the child or overpower the guard and question the children locked down there.
Either way they will learn about Omariâ€™s Food Storage, a place of leverage he uses to keep children working for him.
The children say that Omari keeps his most important maps inside and that all the Soviet documents are inside.

The PCs leave the boat and head to the Food Storage aiming to rescue the papers or feed the children so they might turn on Omari.
The food shortage is closed with a special lock requiring a key.
While there Omari shows up and begins to question their reason for being at the Food Storage.
The players can use this as a way to learn more about Omari and the child labor camp he runs.
