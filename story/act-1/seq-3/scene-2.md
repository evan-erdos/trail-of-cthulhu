EXT. STORAGE HOUSE - MORNING

The Storage house has one STOREHOUSE GUARD outside who appears somewhat bored and is still yawning. He is smoking a cigarette.
~~~


Using Disguise, Language, or Streetwise, the PCs can get past him into the STORAGE HOUSE.

Before entering the STORAGE HOUSE the STOREHOUSE GUARD will ask you to bring him back some water, complaining that his throat is dry after smoking.

INT. STORAGE HOUSE - MORNING

The inside of the STORAGE HOUSE is massive.
Several chambers are interconnected filled with a variety of different foods.
Some are native to Africa, strange herbs that you recall eating during the ceremony at AMBALO’S TRIBE.
Many vats of grain that has been shipped from RUSSIA fill the space.
In the back is a BAKERY, but it isn’t open yet.
The floor has RAT POISON traps everywhere.
Apparently the soviets don’t want to share their food.
Directly adjacent to the BAKERY is a door with russian writing and a water drop on it.

INT. STORAGE HOUSE BAKERY - MORNING

The door of the bakery is locked, but using Locksmith the PCs can open it.
Inside they find a few loaves of fresh BREAD, a dull BREAD KNIFE, and a TIN CUP.
Under the sink is a large container of RAT POISON presumably used to fill the traps.

Eating the BREAD will give players Health +1.

EXT. STORAGE HOUSE WATER TOWER - MORNING

The WATER TOWER isn’t very large, but plays a pivotal role in the Soviet’s survival.
It looks as if once a ladder adorned the side, but now it is long gone leaving only the trail of welded metal shutting the area it once covered.
The faucet of the water tower is chest height and drips of fresh pure water leak onto the moist loam below.
PCs can drink from the WATER TOWER to gain Health +1.

Using the TIN CUP the PCs need to bring a drink out to the STOREHOUSE GUARD.
They can decide whether to poison the drink with RAT POISON to create a scene.
Doing so will cause BORST to yell out for help, soon more soldiers arrive to the scene.
BORST orders them to check the storehouse claiming that someone might have poisoned the STORAGE HOUSE.

While the soldiers search the STORAGE HOUSE, OMARI comes charging out of the MEDICAL WING.
The PCs are free to sneak into the MEDICAL LAB.

INT. SOVIET MEDICAL WING - DAY

The PCs slide into the MEDICAL WING of the facility.
Ahead of them is the MEDICAL LAB, upstairs is ILYA’S QUARTERS.

ILYA’S QUARTERS are locked with an ELECTRONIC LOCK.
The combination makes it more intricate than any locksmith can fathom.
