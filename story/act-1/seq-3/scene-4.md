INT. MEDICAL WING - DAY

Leaving the MEDICAL LAB the PCs run into the ENGINEER.
He asks them about ILYA’s temperment, and looks visibly scared.
The PCs can use LANGUAGE to talk more with him,
he will explain that ILYA has been ill tempered recently because he is unable to get inside a cave that he has been searching for.
The ENGINEER continues by saying that this cave seems impervious to explosives and has many of the soldiers spooked.

Without waiting any longer he bids the PCs farewell and rushes into the MEDICAL LAB.

Using the PAPER the PCs plug the code into the ELECTRONIC LOCK, and thus gain entrance into ILYA’S QUARTERS.

INT. ILYA’S QUARTERS - DAY

The party grabs the JOURNAL.
They also see DOYLA chained to the bedpost, unable to escape.
Questioning her and then convincing her to join the party,
she tells them that they must first go into her room and get an artifact she stole from ILYA... half a MEDALLION.

She tells them it is inside DOYLA’S QUARTERS which is out the back door of ILYA’S QUARTERS and down the stairs.

The PCs leave the room.

INT. DOYLA’S QUARTERS - DAY
Players can search around and learn more about DOYLA and her intentions. On the table is a picture of ILYA holding half of TABLET. He looks unhappy in the photo.

Find the MEDALLION, and return to ILYA’S QUARTERS.

INT. ILYA’S QUARTERS - DAY
The PCs release DOYLA from her shackles.
She joins the party and they all leave the building.
