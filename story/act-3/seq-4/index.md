Once the PCs exit the Moscow Radio building, they hear Hastur's voice rasping voice,
telling them to surrender their minds, that no one is coming to save them.
At this point, Moscow is utterly crawling with possessed citizens and night-ghaunts,
and in the sky, the PCs see a ring of cloud forming around the city's center;
in the ring's middle, they can barely make out the figure of a man.
At this point, the party can choose to either make the probably suicidal trek to Centre 13,
or sneak its way to the center of Moscow to somehow subdue Zolnerowich.
The PCs decide to go with the latter, and they soon find themselves standing at the edge of the Red Square.
