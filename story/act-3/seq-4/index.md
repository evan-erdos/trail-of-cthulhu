The PCs race out of the Moscow Radio building,
alternately dodging the copious electrical wires that are now slithering to life,
glowing with the same yellow light that accompanied Dolya's demise,
and hiding from the whispering figure that has just killed one of their most valuable team members **(Athletics / Stealth / Conceal / Fleeing)**.
As they approach the front door of the building and begin to pry it open,
it suddenly slams shut with yet another yellow flash,
and no amount of pulling and pleading will force it to heave to.
The PCs can hear Ilya's rasping voice, telling them over and over again to surrender their minds,
that no one is coming to save them, but before he can strike them down as he did with Dolya,
the PCs realize that they only have one option left: “Soul Siphon.”
The tablet mentions nothing about moving a soul from an object to a body,
but with Ilya almost breathing down their necks,
the PCs decides that they have nothing to lose.
The group executes the spell, and the door grudgingly groans open,
allowing just enough space for a human-sized body to squeeze through **(Occult / Cthulhu Mythos)**.
The PCs do just that, and as the last PC lifts their hands from the door’s iron face,
the spell immediately breaks; with a shudder and another groan, Moscow Radio’s door reseals itself.
At this point, Moscow is utterly crawling with possessed citizens and nightghaunts,
and in the sky, the PCs see a ring of cloud forming around the city's center.
In the ring's middle, they can barely make out the robed figure of Ilya.
The party can choose to either undertake a most likely suicidal journey to Centre 13,
or sneak its way to the center of Moscow to somehow subdue Ilya's power with the spell they have successfully (barely) executed.
The PCs decide to go with the latter, and they sneak their way down street after street **(Stealth / Conceal / Fleeing)**,
avoiding the gaze of nightghaunt and citizen alike,
until they find themselves standing at the edge of the Red Square itself.
