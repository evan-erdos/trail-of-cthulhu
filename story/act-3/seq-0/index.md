The train rumbles onwards for what seems like months,
with only brief flashes of pale gold light denoting the passage of time in regular illuminated slits.
Then, just as a stomach or two is beginning to audibly rumble, the cold,
musty air of the underground tunnel breaks into an equally cold crispness with a resounding *whoosh*:
the train has emerged into the great outdoors.
The PCs cluster around the slats in the car’s wooden side panels to take a look. In the distance, they can just make out a billowing, colorful structure that wouldn’t look out of place in Constantinople, and surrounding it is a sea of twinkling lights.
**Architecture / History** reveals that this building is none other than the world-famous St. Basil’s Cathedral.
A further **Astronomy** check tells the PCs that the setting sun touching the tip of the cathedral’s greatest spire doesn’t seem to be budging in the slightest.
A **Sense Trouble** check gives the party the tingling impression that all of Moscow’s lights are floating about,
reshaping themselves into an amorphous face with a grin so large,
it looks like it could swallow the party whole.
To the right of Moscow’s grim outline, the PCs spy the dark,
crisscrossing pattern of a steel tower, a blinking red light adorning its top.
**Mechanical Repair / Electrical Repair** determines that this is a radio tower of some sort,
and further use of **History** determines that this is likely just one of many towers that the USSR currently employs in order to jam unwanted radio signals.
Then, the train ducks back into another tunnel, and the car quickly refills with mustiness.
After another hour or so, the train creaks to a halt, and the PCs use **Athletics / Scuffling** to either pry open or partially break the car door.
The party finds themselves on the platform of what looks like an old subway stop. The tunnel is dimly lit,
its concrete walls occasionally shuddering with a far away rumble before settling back down.
History lets the PCs recall that the USSR supposedly built a secret subway alongside Moscow’s official lines;
it was called “Metro-2,” or “D-6” by the KGB,
and was rumored to serve as a quick transport between places of national importance.
A brownish green moss appears to grow in dark clumps across the platform,
and use of **Evidence Collection / Forensics / Outdoorsman** reveals a series of shoeprints,
at first close together and hesitant, but progressively spread apart and erratic;
they seem to disappear off the side of the platform entirely.
A breeze seems to emanate from the gaping mouth of the tunnel ahead of the party:
**Outdoorsman** reveals that the air is coming from outside of Metro-2,
while **Sense Trouble** gives them the sensation of a whispered scream carried along with the wind’s haunting overtones.
Realizing that the only way out is down the tunnel,
they follow the both the breeze and the footprints further in.
Soon they reach a junction in the track;
one fork is blocked up with a decaying wooden sign covered in blocky lettering (Language: Russian):

> Closed for Repairs

**Archaeology / Forensics / Outdoorsman** denotes that the sign has been there for around 10 years.
**Outdoorsman / Sense Trouble** lets the party know that the breeze is coming from the unblocked tunnel, but before they can press on,
they notice the body: alone in the center of the junction,
a human corpse **(Core Clue)** kneels solemnly, its top half missing.
**Medicine / Forensics / Outdoorsman** reveals that the pour soul’s torso was sloppily bitten off.
**Forensics / Outdoorsman** additionally reveals that the attack came from above and behind the victim’s head.
The PCs **Sense Trouble** again, and the breeze transfigures into a shriek.
**Evidence Collection / Forensics** reveals a rusted crowbar **(Core Clue)** stuck in a grate on the side of a wall,
and the PCs use **Athletics** pry it out and yank a couple planks from the blocked railway.
As they squeeze through, they catch a glimpse of a huge dark shape,
its wings pitch black and leathery, its lizard-like muzzle full of sharp black teeth.
**Cthulhu Mythos** deems this to be a Byakhee, one of the space faring servants of Hastur.
The PCs book it, coming across a metallic ladder leading upwards to a metal door with a padlock.
**Forensics / Mechanical Repair** reveal that the padlock is heavily rusted,
and with a few swings of the crowbar **(Athletics)**,
the PCs knock it off of the door and open the contraption wide.
