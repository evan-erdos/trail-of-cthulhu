As the PCs walk Moscow's streets, they bump into a citizen with a strangely watery, dangerous look in their eye.
The citizen begins to tail the party.
The PCs try to lose them, only to find themselves being followed by even more citizens with a similar aura.
From a window atop a nearby apartment building, a light flashes in a strange sequence of patterns: it's Morse code.
