The party explores the radio station, and discover a room containing both a transmitter and Professor Birchwell's gouged-out head,
which looks as if it has been partially eaten.
After tampering with the device, the PCs find that it simply refuses to work, despite looking perfectly functional.
Dolya is mentioning checking the faraway Moscow Radio Centre 13 to see if the signal is jammed,
when the group encounters a bloody-mouthed Zolnerowich in the hallway directly outside the transmitter room.
Dolya tries to shoot Zolnerowich, but he expels the bullet from his body before a tentacle shoots out from behind him,
impaling Dolya through the head.
The PCs hightail it as the sound of maniacal laughter echoes through their brains.
