The party creeps through the darkened, bunker-like halls of the radio station **(Stealth)**,
discovering a number of rooms piled to the brim with black,
monolithic amplifiers with dimmed lights and silent cooling fans,
and soundboards that are absolutely riddled with all sorts of mysterious buttons and knobs.
The floors are covered in a thick tangle of electrical cables, some of them bursting at the seams,
revealing the bloom of coppery-gold filaments stuffed within them.
One of the rooms that the PCs explore also contains a couple of microphones, their puffy coverings chafing,
the swiveling metal arms that once held them proudly aloft now drooping.
Mounted on one of the room’s walls is a plastic panel with a series of lights spread across it;
a closer look determines that this is the station’s “on air” sign,
denoting which rooms are currently in operation **(Mechanical Repair / Electrical Repair)**.
Only one of the panel’s lights glows, casting out a distinctly orange hue that mulls into panic-room red around its periphery:
the tiny black letters at the center of the light matter-of-factly state “Studio 1” **(Languages: Russian)**
The PCs surmises that this may be the only room in the building from which the party may send a distress signal.
In a nearby hallway, they discover a moderately large slab of steel bolted to the wall,
a series of meticulous engravings spanning its surface:
it’s a map of Radio Moscow **(Architecture / Languages: Russian)**.
The PCs use it to their advantage, fumbling their way to Studio 1,
which (lo and behold) contains a transmitter,
its lights still flashing and cooling fans still whirring.
However, when they attempt to shout into the plastic headset,
they are only answered with an empty, gut-wrenching static.
The party leaves the room in a huff, and just as Dolya is mentioning trekking to Moscow Radio Centre 13 to see if someone is jamming the signal,
the group encounters a dark, flowing shape standing in the middle of the hallway,
its base wriggling with formless shadows.
Ilya's voice echoes out from the shade, and Dolya tries to shoot him with her trusty rifle,
but the bullet springs from his body and falls to the floor with a solitary clink.
A tentacle shoots out from behind him,
impaling Dolya through the head and writhing about in a weird burst of yellow light;
it’s as if her very essence is being sucked out.
She drops to the floor, and the PCs hightail it as the sound of maniacal laughter echoes through their brains.
