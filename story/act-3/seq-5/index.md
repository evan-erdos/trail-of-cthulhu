title:   Clouds Around St. Basil's
seq:     5
---


The PCs see that the aforementioned cloud ring is now encircling St. Basil's Cathedral.
As they cross the Red Square, they notice that the city's possessed denizens are collapsing en masse: they are dead.
The PCs enter St. Basil's and are greeted by Zolnerowich descending from the ceiling.
The party escapes into the cathedral's labyrinthine hallways upon recalling Zolnerowich's obsession with Professor Birchwell's spell book,
and they quickly scan its passages while simultaneously evading their foe.
They then find a spell that will allow the PCs to siphon the god from Zolnerwich's body into theirs'.
