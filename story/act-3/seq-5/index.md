title:  With Open Arms
---

The PCs see that the aforementioned cloud ring is lowering more and more,
completely encircling the central spire of St. Basil's Cathedral **(Occult / Cthulhu Mythos)**.
They also see that the Red Square is teeming with possessed citizens,
enough to totally surround them if they try to make a break for it. H
owever, the moment the party take a step onto the square’s meticulously placed cobblestones,
the people populating the space begin to drop dead as the area around their stomachs seem to flash with a familiar yellow light,
which then forms itself into orbs and darts its way towards the cathedral at the other end of the square.
The PCs cross to St. Basil’s and attempt to force open the grand wooden door that serves as the cathedral’s front entrance,
to no avail. Then, a single word slithers into their heads:
"manners..." The group knocks politely, and the door creaks open, beckoning them inside.
They enter St. Basil's and carefully creep their way around its labyrinthine, fantastically mural-covered hallways until they cross the threshold of the cathedral’s central chapel:
the Church of Intercession.
As soon as they go inside, organ music begins to float into their heads,
and when they look up towards the domed ceiling of the spire above,
they see Ilya in the flesh: he floats downward, his body and face completely swathed in a loose yellow robe,
his arms outstretched in a gesture that seems to say “welcome,”
a mass of tentacles hanging from where one would expect his feet to be protruding from.
The party escapes into the cathedral's hallways,
finding various ways to stun Ilya so that they can each enact “Soul Siphon” on him
(just two of these options involve either shooting down hanging lamps and chandeliers while he is standing under them,
or luring him into a bell in St. Basil’s bell tower and ringing it).
