Once they make their may to street-level, the group finds that Moscow is starting to flood with the waters of the river Moskva.
As they slosh through the water-filled streets, dodging around corners and behind mounds of detritus to avoid groups of citizens at every turn **(Stealth / Conceal / Fleeing / Streetwise)**, Dolya suggests that the group get to Radio Moscow in order to make a call for at least some sort of aid.
Unfortunately, this means that they must cross the river,
a prospect that is made all the more horrifying the moment that they trace their way to its overflowing banks.
Upon arriving at the side of the river, the PCs witness a shadowy,
slippery form burst from the depths and flail about with a screaming man in its clutches before quickly descending back to whence it came.
The PCs attempt to investigate alternate routes to the radio station,
but they find that both of the major bridges that are still above water are either teeming with nightghaunts or smashed to pieces.
This forces Dolya and the rest of the party to plunge into the Moskva and make a break for the other side,
during which they must dodge the gigantic tentacle-like being that they saw earlier.
Luckily, they reach the other side, clamber their way out of the river,
dash up to the Radio Moscow building,
lock-pick their way through the brutish cast-iron door and slam it shut behind them **(Athletics / Fleeing)**. The tentacle, nearing the end of its reach,
pounds on the door and pulls at the building’s concrete façade, but to no avail.
