title:  Faces Come Out of the Rain
---

The party steps into a dark room with tall, salmon-colored walls.
To their left, a gigantic wooden boat stands ghostly erect,
and to their right is a glass case full of assorted gold pieces.
**History / Archaeology** reveal the boat to be an old longboat excavated from the river Volga,
and the gold pieces to be ancient Scythian artifacts;
**History / Library Use** will additionally reveal that these two collections could only have recently crossed paths in one place.
This is it: Moscow’s State Historical Museum.
As the PCs study the room’s contents, the doorway leading back down to Metro-2 falls shut with a clattering *bang*.
From far away, footsteps start to clack hurriedly towards the PCs’ position.
The party uses **Stealth / Conceal / Fleeing** to hide themselves in the room,
either inside the longboat, or behind the Scythian pieces’ case.
A museum guard fumbles his way in, muttering to himself about how there’s no such thing as ghosts (Languages: Russian).
As he passes by the PCs’ hiding spot, they use **Scuffling / Intimidation** to grab the guard,
secure his pistol and clamp a hand over his twitching mouth.
They then press him to disclose the location of Rasputin’s prayer belt **(Interrogation / Intimidation)**,
which ultimately works when supplemented with a pistol pressed to the back of his neck.
The guard guides the party to a cramped hallway at the very back of the museum:
the walls are covered in Byzantine-esque portraits of religious figures that almost feel like they’re watching you **(Sense Trouble)**,
and at the end of the hall, flanked by two fairly large windows, is another glass case,
this one containing a black twist of rope covered in strange and familiar symbols:
it’s Rasputin’s prayer belt.
**Occult / Archaeology** reveals that each of the belt’s lines of symbols constitutes a specific alphabet:
among them is the strange tongue inscribed on the tablet in the PCs’ possession,
and among the numerous others are Phoenician and Ancient Greek.
The PCs use the belt to finally translate the mysterious tablet **(Cryptography + Languages: Phoenician or Greek)** and learn of the Soul Siphon spell,
a spells that drains an individual’s souls from their body into the caster’s through physical contact.
Just then, a screech ripples through the hallway and the Byakhee appears.
In a single sweeping motion, it bites the guard’s clean off and swipes at the PCs with its tail,
sending them crashing through one of the nearby windows.
As they hurtle towards the street below, the Byakhee launches itself after them,
and the party only has a few turns to grapple themselves onto the beast’s creased hide **(Scuffling / Riding)** before they crash to the cobblestoned earth.
The fall kills the Byakhee, and leaves the players extremely shaken.
This is not helped by the fact that a number of passersby are stopping to stare with an eerie,
watery look in their eye, as if they are actually somewhere far away;
a yellow glow seems to shine from under their clothing,
always around the area where their stomach would be **(Biology / Medicine)**.
As the citizens begin to inch closer to the party, they quickly beat it,
ducking through various crevices between buildings in order to elude their pursuers **(Stealth / Conceal / Fleeing)**.
Then, from a window atop a nearby apartment building, a light flashes in a strange sequence of patterns:
it's a Morse S.O.S **(Cryptography / Outdoorsman)**.
The PCs force their way into the apartment building,
and are greeted with a musty lobby that is absolutely drenched in dark burgundy carpeting and upholstery.
Quickly, they heave a few faded couches into the doorway to prevent their pursuers from tailing them **(Athletics / Preparedness)**,
and make their way to a nearby elevator.
After pressing the “up” call button and waiting for a few excruciating seconds,
the paneled doors part and the party squeezes themselves inside.
The elevator creaks and groans its way up to the top floor,
shuddering a few times along the way.
As the doors open once more and the PCs step out,
the elevator emits one final groan before its cable snaps with a thick twang,
sending the little box shrieking down its rusty supports to the ground floor far below.
The PCs then begin the process of searching each room to find out who (or what) was sending out that Morse signal.
After using the view from at least two of these rooms to pinpoint its source,
they break in and find Dolya holed up in said apartment, toting a rifle.
The PCs help her barricade her door with a hefty armchair to buy them some time **(Athletics / Preparedness)**,
and as they talk with her,
Dolya reveals that she arrived here nearly a week ago,
and fled to this miserable little place after she, too,
had a fairly unpleasant encounter with Moscow’s glassy-eyed denizens **(Interrogation)**.
She also adds that their behavior became even more erratic after a radio broadcast featuring Ilya's voice unexpectedly came on the air.
Suddenly, the group of possessed citizens that has been slowly gathering outside her door in a murmuring mass attempts to break in,
and the PCs, along with Dolya, escape by scaling the apartment building’s façade,
climbing from window ledge to window ledge,
all the while evading the grasping hands of yet more citizens **(Athletics / Fleeing)**.
