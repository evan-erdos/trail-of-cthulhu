On their way out of the cathedral,
one of the PCs stops by the side of a dead citizen's body,
pulls a pistol out of its grip and calmly turns it onto their compatriots.

They reiterate Hastur's words:
they can either submit their minds to Hastur
(and possibly regain control of their bodies in the future), or die.
