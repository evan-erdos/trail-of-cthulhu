Once each of the PCs pull off the spell successfully, Ilya freezes in his tracks.
With an unearthly scream, he clutches desperately at his face and melts into a mound of sulfurous ash.
With a clank, the Mask of Hastur falls down onto the church’s brick floor.
What is more, any nearby nightghaunts that appeared during the course of the battle inside the cathedral emit screams of their own before their bodies violently fold in on each other like collapsing stars and disappear in a puff of black.
On their way out of St. Basil’s, as the group stumbles their way back across the Red Square in an aimless bid to follow the presumably now-clear path to Centre 13,
one of the PCs stops by the side of a dead citizen's body,
pulls a pistol out of its grip and calmly turns it onto their compatriots.
They reiterate Hastur's words:
the remaining PCs can either submit their minds to him and possibly regain control of their bodies in the future, or die.
The remaining PCs overpower and kill their possessed friend **(Interrogation / Athletics / Scuffling / Firearms)** before realizing that the only way to stop themselves from turning into Hastur-vessels is to kill themselves.
The longer they debate the situation, the more of them succumb to Hastur's influence and must be killed.
Soon, there is one PC left.
If they take too long to kill themselves, Hastur possesses them and the game is lost,
but if they do **(Firearms)**, then the game is ostensibly won;
Hastur has been sealed away for at least another millennium... or two.
