The PCs pull off the spell successfully, leaving Zolnerowich dead on the altar steps.
On their way out of the cathedral, one of the PCs stops by the side of a dead citizen's body,
pulls a pistol out of its grip and calmly turns it onto their compatriots.
They reiterate Hastur's words:
the remaining PCs can either submit their minds to Hastur and possibly regain control of their bodies in the future, or die.
The remaining PCs overpower and kill their possessed friend.
They then realize that the only way to stop themselves from turning into Hastur-vessels is to kill themselves.
The longer they debate the situation, the more of them succumb to Hastur's influence and must be killed.
Soon, there is one PC left.
If they take too long to kill themselves, Hastur possesses them and the game is lost,
but if they do, then the game is ostensibly won;
Hastur has been sealed away for at least another millennium...or two.
