The **[Players][]** must pinpoint the location of Ilyaâ€™s whereabouts,
and figure out why the mask was more important than the monster.

They discover documents of a hidden camp site near the tribal village.
It seems to be a temple to this God with No Name they had been excavating.

At the temple there is a well-hidden Soviet base that they had not seen before.
Investigating it leads to the discovery of **[Professor Birchwell][]**,
who seems to have been experimented on.
