title:  The Yellow King
---


Having lost the yellow mask to Ilya the PCs must now leave the cave and back into the area surrounding the cave where the soviets have left leaving behind a half-burned campsite.
However, with the soviets having abandoned the camp in somewhat of a hurry there are clear signs that some important documents may have been forgotten. Also with the camp having been transported over with the cave system the way the PCs came in from has been blocked and they must now figure out to leave the ruins. There also seems to be some sounds coming from a building but that could be merely the sound of rodents. Dolya also notes that Ilya’s tent is now unguarded and open to investigate.
The PCs spend time here to try to pinpoint their current location, how to escape and why the mask was more important than the powerful monster Architecture/Archaeology/History can be used to discover that the camp was setup on ruins of a much larger village. Oral History/Anthropology shows that the village worshipped a God of No Name. Further investigation Art History/Occult shows that they also worshipped several other gods over the time all that they call the sons of the God of No Name. Dolya mentions hearing the same from the tribes in the regions, Borst agrees and adds that the villagers who were involved with that God were all friendly to Ilya’s forces. This begins a conversation between the two on the ethics of the soviets relation to the villagers.
Literature/Language helps in discovering documents of an excavation the artifacts from which were used in creating some kind of device that was stored in a nearby building. Investigating {Sense Trouble/General Inquiry/Athletics} the now ruined building leads to the discovery of the professor who seems to have been experimented on. Interrogating him {Interrogation + Dialogue Session Improvising Keeper + Improvising Player, using well-defined Journal} with his spell-book/journal leads him to talk sometimes coherently and sometimes incoherently, depending on the Overall Sanity of the Party. {If the journal is not with the, it will be there in the room with him, left behind by the soviets who no longer consider it necessary}
He does mention about the King with the Yellow mask during times ancient being the same as the God of No Name. He also mentions the Yellow one could not find his other half, and that it angered him to no end.
Investigating the manuscripts near him {Documents handed to the players} leads to the PCs discovering that it was not a biological sleep disturbing sickness that the professor and Ilya were interested in. Those were merely side-effects of a dream-based hypnosis.
Sense Trouble as a general call out or a request of a lay of the campsite will disclose an underground lab underneath Ilya’s tent, this underground area is only revealed because it has an aura similar to the flesh monster and was unnoticeable without it. Apart from this if the PCs have any explosives from the past they could merely blow themselves out however this would be more expensive {Explosives 2} than investigating their way out and will probably all need a Stability check. Failure on this check would lead to a loss of health due to injury via shrapnel, the collapsing camp, or just the blast.
The underground area smells of rotting flesh and the stench seems new. Using Sense Trouble the players notice that the passage way was a secret tunnel made by Ilya to go out on his own in search of subjects to experiment on. One of the tables in an enclosure of the passage has a dead bull on it. Cut up and salted. Although the experiment seems ritualistic in nature. Also there are various human remains that seem freshly desecrated from which the flesh monsters stench seems to be emitting from. A quick investigation will show that these carcasses have been recently chewed on {The Flesh Monster may have survived/revived…..}. As they keep moving through the tunnel they notice a light at the end and exit the area.
As they step out of the ruins into the campsite, they notice that the surroundings are no longer that of the African region that they had just left but colder and more barren, it seems more akin to Eastern Europe (Sanity and Stability checks as required). They can see four areas of populace because of smoke in the cold air. From the distance they are at one seems to be a decently large sea dock. The second is a small town that seems nestled into a hilly region. The third seems to be that of a large encampment. The last one is a nearby watch tower camp that has a few tents. It seems that the temple, the surrounding soviet campsite has been somehow spatially transferred to a hill overlooking the region.
The PCs decide to go to the closest smoke signal (watch tower camp) near the transported cave-base. To get there they must commandeer a damaged car {Electrical Repair/Driving/Mechanical Repair} (Borst can drive the car). This base seems empty; those who occupied the location seemed to have run away very recently {Sense Trouble}. The base seems to have some moist wooden crates that contain a few artifacts {A statue and an epithet} pointing to a War between a Sea God and Storm God as well as Lore about the God of No Name and his priestess on Earth. The artifacts seem to have been excavated recently, due to the signs of uncleaned dirt and hasty packaging.
Any checks on the electrical or mechanical equipment {Electrical Repair/Mechanical Repair/Preparedness/Streetwise}, gets a radio or equipment cackling with Russian coming over the lines. The talk seems to be militaristic and is saying something about protecting the leader and moving forces to defend Krasnodar Krai. Further chatter is about the Black Sea Fleet being usurped by Ilya’s dirty pirate {Omari} who has now gone insane. An area of the mechanical/electrical room seems to contain various maps {Archaeology, Outdoorsman, Streetwise, Sense Trouble} of the soviet bases in the region they are now in. It seems they have been moved the Soviet Byzantine Forward Base in the Krasnodar Krai region {Sanity and Stability checks as needed}.
The chatter on the radio grows louder, the door to the building bursts open and heavily armed soviet soldiers quickly surround the party.
