They discover documents of a hidden camp site near the tribal village.[^0]
It seems to be a temple to this God with No Name they had been excavating.
To get there they must commandeer a damaged car.[^1]

The PCs stumble upon some ruins,
which indicate the existence of other gods in the region that have been sealed away.
They are then chased by Soviets who are attempting to destroy what is left of the other bases.
These Soviets can be dealt with or tracked to a different base.
The base contains artifacts which point to a War between a Sea God and Storm God,
as well as Lore about the God of No Name and his priestess on Earth.
