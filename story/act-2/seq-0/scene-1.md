The PCs must pinpoint the location of Ilyaâ€™s whereabouts,
and figure out why the mask was more important than the monster.

They discover that the camp was setup on the ruins.[^0]
The village worshipped not the God they had been led to believe, but rather a God of No Name.[^1]
Further investigation shows that they also worshipped several other gods,
all considered the sons of the God of No Name.

Dolya mentions hearing similar stories from the tribes in the regions.
