Having lost the Yellow Mask to Ilya, the **[Players][]** must now leave the cave.
When they return to the area surrounding the cave,
they discover that the Soviets have left leaving behind a half-burned campsite.

Sense Trouble shows that they were in a hurry to leave.
The **[Players][]** can use their abilities to investigate the half burned camp,
which is no longer as secure as before.
