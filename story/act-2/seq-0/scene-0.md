Having lost the Yellow Mask to Ilya, the PCs must now leave the cave.
When they return to the area surrounding the cave,
they discover that the Soviets have left leaving behind a half-burned campsite.

Sense Trouble shows that they were in a hurry to leave.
The PCs can use their abilities to investigate the half burned camp,
which is no longer as secure as before.
