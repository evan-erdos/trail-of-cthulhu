They discover a well-hidden Soviet Base in a temple, which they didn't notice before.
In the base, they find Professor Birchwell, who seems to have been experimented on.

Interrogating him with his Grimoire is inconsistent:
he's sometimes coherent and sometimes not,
depending on the overall sanity of the Party.
He does mention the King with the Yellow Mask may be the same as the God of No Name.
He also mentions the Yellow One could not find his other half,
and that it angered him to no end.
Investigating the manuscripts reveals the true nature of the village's sickness.
It was not a biological sleep disturbing sickness,
it was the influence of a dream-based hypnosis.
This is why Professor Birchwell and Ilya were interested in this village.

At this point the PCs are ambushed by the natives.
