Returning to the school and searching for the hidden passage to the ancient ruins,
the **[Players][]** find a lab built into a ruin.

**[Borst][]** sees a picture at the lab which causes him to run away in fear.
**[Dolya][]** too looks at and starts to take deep breaths.

It depicts **[Ilya][]**, destroying a pillar of sanity of the **[Player][]**.
If the **[Professor][]** is shown this,
his reaction is such:

> How has he met the Yellow Sign, hidden on the dark side of the moon?

**[Dolya][]** also wonder out loud what could have frightened **[Borst][]** so much that he ditched the party and ran away.
