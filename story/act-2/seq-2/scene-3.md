Investigating the lab shows research being done on sleeping agents and drugs.
Their research goes so far as using electrical impulses to stimulate dreams.

They realize that the system was rigged to affect the whole region near the Lab and the Village.
The **[Players][]** can question the **[Professor][]**,
who reveals much about the decisions they made earlier,
leading to the release of the Mask was under the influence of this system.

Looking into the temple ruins the **[Players][]** discover hieroglyphs,
which speak of the God of No Name and the Masked King;
all of which indicates a single thing.
Under the rule of both the God and the King,
people built monuments reaching to the sky, as if in homage to something.

Remembering the words of the old leader of the tribes,
these monuments may be the pillars that are erected to summon the God.

One of the ruins is also show to be a pillar.
Approaching it and investigating it causes a vision of a huge, incorporeal being.
Sometimes, it appears as a dragon, sometimes a kraken,
sometimes a robed figure akin to a human,
trapped in an area of void on the dark side of the moon.
