In order to investigate the tablet further,
the PCs bring it back to the hidden Soviet camp.
Using academic abilities to study it allows them to see a vision.
They see a Moon, Sea, Priestess, Storm, Yellow-Masked King,
and a warrior with a bull horned helmet.

They also see a vision of Professor Birchwell and Ilya talking about a bull,
which has been killed and stored somewhere in the hidden facility.

When they investigate the dead bull stored in the hidden camp,[^0]
it teaches the PCs that the bull was killed in a very specific way.
It was chained with iron, hammered into stone,
and slowly dehydrated with over-salted food.

They can test various theories of what the tablet visions meant with the Professor.
He reacts to things about Moon, Dream, Sea and Storm,
each with a tale about ancient gods and priestesses.
