Act 3 attempts to re-teach the PCs about what has actually happened in the two previous acts while getting them deeper into both the threat of Ilya and the Old God that was summoned.
They have been spatially moved to Russia in what seems to be the winter of 1952.
They learn of what led Ilya to Africa.
They explore the USSR Byzantine Forward Base Camp.
Here they run into the usurped Russian leader Joseph Stalin, who orders them to do his dirty work for freedom.
Omari in the meantime takes over the Black Sea Fleet creating a dire situation for everyone nearby.
This is where both their alliesâ€™ loyalties and their loyalty to their allies are tested.
Through this campaign the team learns that the Russians are lost as to what to do as well as discover a part of a tablet that if deciphered could help them defeat Ilya.
Underlying suggestions are laid with regards to the clash of religions and old gods, Hastur and his relationship to the region, knowledge of the occult lets you the player see more while others in the world see you as less.
The act ends with the players boarding an underground train to Moscow following the clues left behind by the orthodox healer Grigori Rasputin protected by the remnants of his heretic cult.
