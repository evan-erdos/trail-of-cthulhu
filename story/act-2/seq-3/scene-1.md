The **[Players][]** are now able to access various parts of the underground temple.
There are two pillars on the other side of the camp opposite the temple.

One is a pillar of space that has inscribed on it various hieroglyphs,
which depict people using portals to teleport.[^0]

The other is a pillar of time that also has hieroglyphs.[^1]
They show the dead coming back to life as their youthful selves.
Both seem to be connected to a singular entity.

Having looked at both of the pillars,
the **[Players][]** also notice a pond just beyond the two.


[^0]: Egyptian hieroglyphs, to be precise.
[^1]: Greek in origin.
