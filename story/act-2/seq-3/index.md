The Leader of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stood before the party. He nods to his soldiers and they comply, forcing the party on their knees in front of their General Secretary.
He looks down on the team without turning his head down. He with a soft and polite voice says to the team,
‘It seems I was not wrong in my choice, Borst did not lie, you know how to investigate that which we do not comprehend, that which science is yet to catch up to. While he did argue well for you the logic was… well… I believe the word is… lacking. I decided to test you’
Stalin is brought a chair and he sits down still not really looking at the PCs but in their general direction.
‘I know that you want to go home, yes…I can help you. However there are items that peak each of your interests, which are also of interest to me ’
Stalin rattles off an impeccable argument as to why the PC should do what is asked of them in order not only further their own personal growth but also in order to escape. {Keeper Prepare Beforehand}
He motions to Borst and tells him that Borst shall be his eyes, ears and mouth to the team. Borst salutes him for being giving the honor of the post. Stalin takes one look at the farm and as he stands says
‘Burn this filthy place to the ground so it may regrow to be used to make the Mother Land splendorous’.
The players are led out of the building which is immediately set on fire.
Stalin looks at the flames and exclaims that the next to burn will be those who defy the USSR and those who claim it from him - the false gods, who will burn with in the flames of his fury. He starts throwing religious texts from various time periods and religions into the flame, most of them seem to belong to the Orthodoxy. Yet he also sighs, saying the Nightghaunt would have made excellent research material in order to enhance their soldiers.
He turns to the PCs and tells them that have several tasks that if completed would raise him above any God. He says of the tasks the PCs should investigate the Lab previously mentioned as it was where Ilya first concocted his plan and it might help understand what drug or human enhancement he had in his position. Another task involved getting back the Black Sea Fleet from Omari. He claims that it is not some God nor some magic that Ilya is using but sufficiently advanced technology and that by learning it, enhancing it and applying it would they be able to become even stronger. If any player attempts to cut him off and tries to use any proof from previous parts of the campaign he will throw the item into the fire or play to their pillars of sanity in order to provide a logical and sound argument. All the soviet forces are in awe of him and his regality.
After saying what he needs to and refuting al essence of the occult Stalin and his retinue get into their vehicles and drive back to their lodgings.
As soon as Stalin leaves Dolya comes out and tells the PCs that Stalin has been ousted from Moscow and Ilya sits on the seat of power there. She has discovered that there seems to be a connection between this region, Rasputin’s origins and plans to legitimize the royalty as descendants of God that has brought Stalin here in an attempt to defeat Ilya.
At this point Borst and Dolya argue about the validity of Stalin’s claims that science would be the way to defeat Ilya and the mask he took.
The players are taken to their room on the main camp where Borst has had soldiers bring in maps and notes about both the dock where Omari has holed up and the abandoned lab of Ilya.
The plan seems to be to find whatever necessary from the lab and then to steal back the fleet to provide firepower from Omari. Borst argues for the fleet as military power is far superior to any other and might is right, Dolya argues that if she can figure out what triggered Ilya she may be able to stop him as that is the morally right thing to do.
The PCs decide that before going into a fight against a military force they should research the lab to see if they can find anything {chosen for this story}
As they drive to the lab they see more of the interspersed huts. The PCs can ask about it but will only get the response of ‘seem to be connected with storing and moving goods’.
On reaching the lab the party can start to investigate it. There are multiple blocks to the lab, a manufactory, a chemistry lab, a morgue and a housing area.
In the manufactory they find various orthodox artifacts that are in various states of disrepair. As the soviets almost sealed it immediately once they realized that the Ilya had turned, most of the medical devices seem to be relatively intact while non-operable. Investigating the instruments show that they were used to precision cut various materials into a particular face-like shape. {Physics/ Sense Trouble}. Around the manufactory in various storage locker are materials that were clearly taken from various religious sites – stone, wood, metal. {Geology/ Occult/ Evidence Collection}. Using Electrical + Mechanical Repair + Craft the PCs can get the machines working again to manufacture a mask, not unlike the one that Ilya stole.
In the chemistry lab they find various raw materials as well as a residue in the chemical production system that had been setup. Also there is a workbench with various blueprints lying around. Examining the raw materials show them to be a mix of materials that are from the local region and those from various locations around both the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. {Chemistry/ Geology/ Biology} The residue in the chemical production kit is found to be the residue of an aerosol that could be used to place suggestions on people. {Chemistry/ Biology/ Forensics}. Examining the blueprints show that a special remote dispersal system had been created in order to place it in various ventilation systems without being too obvious. The other blueprints are strikingly similar to the building they had been housed in during their time in Africa. If Borst is questioned about it, he will admit that he knew that the Soviets had built the building but had no idea about the aerosol or its dispersal device. This means that the PCs decisions may have been influenced by the Soviets without them knowing.  A quick check on their blood reveals that while there are trace amounts of the chemical in their bloodstream it is mostly gone. The PCs can collect some of these chemical samples to hand over to the soviets {Evidence Collection}.
In the morgue there are multiple skeletons that have dried out. Forensics will show that these skeletons were from a century prior. The experiments on the skeletons seems to have something to do with ritual carvings into the bones that seem to have been carved into the bones when the people were still alive. Examining the carvings {Languages/ Occult} show that they have to do with souls, retention and reconstruction.
The housing area is devoid of anything except for bed frames and cabinets. However one of the frames has an odd indent carved into it. If the players examine it closely they will find a hint of machinations being a part of the reason why the indent is so oddly shaped. If the PCs have made a mask they can place it in the indent to uncover the entrance to a hidden temple under the lab. Dolya at this point is fascinated by both the lab and the documents that are strewn all over the building, in her continued attempt to understand what got her friend killed; she remains behind hoping that the answer may be here somewhere.
