The knowledge that the PCs have gained from the vision has changed them.

The PCs are now able to access various parts of the underground temple.
There are two pillars on the other side of the camp opposite the temple.
They have a vision of an ancient period where people move around like zombies.
They bow to a king wearing a mask, and the PCs are drawn closer to this being.

Dolya is possessed by Hastur.
At this point the Professor uses a spell to stop the possession.

At this point the pond becomes a real physical pond.

The Professor can be questioned but he has gone back to his rambling.
The pond has a temple in the middle of it and the PCs can investigate this temple.
