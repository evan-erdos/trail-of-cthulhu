They will not be able to reach it,
and by spending their abilities they realize that it's not real:
it's a phenomena similar to a mirage but is not being caused by heat and light.

The shimmer is caused by darkness, but they can see past the shadow,
and they observe that it has a yellow outline to it.[^0]

This triggers a vision of an ancient period where people move around like zombies.

They bow to a king wearing a mask, and the PCs are drawn closer to this being.
Suddenly, it looks at them.
