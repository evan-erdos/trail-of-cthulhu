The temple is ancient and seems to have been repurposed for different religions and idols over the years. Apart from the styles of the Orthodox artists there are some Serbian, Jewish and Turkish architectural influences as well. {Architecture}.
On each side of the temple stand 3 grand pillars. On one side there is clear marking for space and the other side for time. None of the 6 pillars have stood the test of time. A pillar marked future is broken and in pieces.
As the players walk into the temple they notice that they are in the outer sanctum which is maze like in its form. There are many dead bodies and skeletons strewn around, clearly of people having lost their way. Borst immediately exclaims he can no longer see the exit and if the PCs look around they too notice that they can no longer see the way they had gotten in. They realize that they must commit to moving forward.
An Outdoorsman/ Architecture can realize that the maze is reflected in a large mirror on top of the outer sanctum, however Sense Trouble shows that this reflection is hazy and not perfect.
In order to reach the inner sanctum the PCs must each face one of their pillars of sanity and must embrace that perhaps science is not the answer but rather an acceptance that science cannot explain everything is required. {Improvising Keeper makes a scenario + Improvising players react to scenario}
Before entering the inner sanctum on a pedestal stands a weathered notebook. Examining the weathered notebook reveals that only one page is legible. The text on the page seemed to be intended to be written to not make sense similar to a codex of some kind.
Upon entering the inner sanctum temple the first thing that is noted is the vastness of the room. The room itself is perfectly sept-agonal. Apart from the entrance there are 6 rooms each labeled the same as the pillars outside. Point, Line, Space, Past, Present, Future. In the flooring of the center hall where the PCs stand is a very large icon of a cross.
Further exploration of the temple without going into any room will show that this was a muzhik meditation ground for the migrant Serbian monks of the Orthodoxy {Architecture/ Archaeology/ Anthropology}. It is interesting that similar marking to the old church can be found if examining the door of the Future room. Closer examination of the markings {Art History} will show that it is a Serbian form of Russian and says ‘I, Rasputin seal this door as it undermines the authority of the Royal Family. A power capable of undermining the ruler can only be reeled n through division.’
Other rooms have illegible scratches on them.
Forcing open the Future door they discover a stone tablet similar to the one smashed by Ilya.  This one however is different in that it feels less of a long-worded epitaph and more like runic script of some kind. A closer investigation of the tablet with any skill will reveal that some kind of codex is required to understand what the tablet says. The carvings on the bones from the lab upstairs seems to be related but none of them will solve the tablet for the players. However the players can then realize that the notes could be deciphered and it says ‘the tablet I have found here will protect our future, I will keep the codex around me at all times.’
Entering any other room will begin a vision for the player who requested to do so with regards to an event in the past that had occurred showing it in new light exposing knowledge not previously known, or something in the present that may change the course of the plan that they are following, or something with regards to 1 dimensions, 2 dimensions or the aspect of 3 dimensional space. {With a necessary Sanity test}
