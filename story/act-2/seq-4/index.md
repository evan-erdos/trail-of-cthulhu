The **[Players][]** hear a huge explosion coming from above.
As the **[Players][]** escape, they hear that Borst has taken over the remnants of the Soviets.
Borst calls for the death of all of those who follow the old gods.

Escaping the Soviets the **[Players][]** end up at a tribal village.

The tribe turns out to be cannibalistic and attacks them.

The **[Players][]** end up at the camp site (chosen for this path of the story),
where Borst is burning idols and people in the name of the Orthodox Church.
The flame gets out of hand, and destroys much of the campsite.

He then takes the rest of the Russian contingency to the docks,
where they began preparation to sail back to Russia.

The **[Players][]** sneak into the docks and confront Borst.

Borst gives up that Omari whose supply chain had been destroyed in the partyâ€™s attempt to stop Ilya,
who is probably the only one who could help them now.
