The PCs end up at the camp site (chosen for this path of the story),
where Borst is burning idols and people in the name of the Orthodox Church.
The flame gets out of hand, and destroys much of the campsite.

He then takes the rest of the Russian contingency to the docks,
where they began preparation to sail back to Russia.
