The PCs hear a huge explosion coming from above.
They wander out of the hidden area to see the entire area of fire.
The Soviets are hell bent on ending the insanity that Professor Birchwell and Ilya started.

As the PCs escape, they hear that Borst has taken over the remnants of the Soviets,
and is slowly closing down the borders and preventing anyone or thing from escaping an intended purge.
As they leave the area a widespread broadcast is made;
Borst calls for the death of all of those who follow the old gods.

The Soviets also want to destroy all evidence of such insanity,
and come after the PCs to destroy their notes and the spell book.
