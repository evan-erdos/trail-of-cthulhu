Escaping the Soviets, the PCs end up at a tribal village,
each of which supports the "Drowned God" and make sacrifices in his name.

The PCs are treated well,
and the elder speaks to them about the seeing the Yellow sign medallion.

The tribe however turn out to be a Cannibalistic tribe and attack.[^0]
The PCs flee and sneak through the jungle to a safe area,
from where they can choose to go to the city or back to a camp to recuperate.

[^0]: While they can fight, they would flee for this.
