Escaping the Soviets, the **[Players][]** end up at a tribal village,
each of which supports the "Drowned God" and make sacrifices in his name.

The **[Players][]** are treated well,
and the elder speaks to them about the seeing the Yellow sign medallion.

The tribe however turn out to be a Cannibalistic tribe and attack.[^0]
The **[Players][]** flee and sneak through the jungle to a safe area,
from where they can choose to go to the city or back to a camp to recuperate.

[^0]: While they can fight, they would flee for this.
