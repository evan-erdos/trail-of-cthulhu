During the journey to the tribal leader,
the **[Players][]** are provided with evidence from the tribesman.
This evidence shows a different side to a lot of what has been told to them by the **[Professor][]**.
**[Dolya][]** and **[Borst][]** have an argument on the role of the Soviets,
and who should be blamed for the death of so many tribes.
The **[Players][]** must decide who is right, however,
their relationship with the other will be irreparably damaged.
