The natives who ambush the **[Players][]** can either be fought or negotiated with.
If they fight, they lose a vital meeting with the tribal leader.
If negotiated with, the tribal people take the **[Players][]** to their leader,
who then bestows upon them some **Occult** and **Cthulhu Mythos**.[^0]
