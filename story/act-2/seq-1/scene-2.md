They side with Dolya.
The tribal lord explains to the PCs that for ages,
the tribe has protected the world from the sealed God of No Name.
The God of No Name seeks to rule as King once more.
He does not have clarity as to where Ilya could be taking the mask,
but does say that to awaken the God to his full power,
the 3 pillars of space (3 dimensions) and the 3 pillars of time
(past, present and future) must be erected.

He also provides the PCs with Medallions of the Yellow Sign,
saying that the following and learning from the sign will teach them the truths of the world.
He leaves them with a statement of the sign,
saying that it will save the world of others and change the world of theirs,
what this means is left open and the tribal chief will not answer any further.
