The natives who ambush the PCs can either be fought or negotiated with.
If negotiated with, the tribal people take the PCs to their leader.

During the journey to the tribal leader,
the PCs are provided with evidence from the tribesman.
Dolya and Borst have an argument on the role of the Soviets.
The PCs must decide who is right.

They side with Dolya.
The tribal lord explains to the PCs that for ages,
the tribe has protected the world from the sealed God of No Name.

He also provides the PCs with Medallions of the Yellow Sign,
saying that the following and learning from the sign will teach them the truths of the world.

The PCs can now enter the temple.
Upon investigating the temple they find more homage to the God of No Name.
They also find information about the pillars.
