The natives who ambush the **[Players][]** can either be fought or negotiated with.
If negotiated with, the tribal people take the **[Players][]** to their leader.

During the journey to the tribal leader,
the **[Players][]** are provided with evidence from the tribesman.
**[Dolya][]** and **[Borst][]** have an argument on the role of the Soviets.
The **[Players][]** must decide who is right.

They side with **[Dolya][]**.
The tribal lord explains to the **[Players][]** that for ages,
the tribe has protected the world from the sealed God of No Name.

He also provides the **[Players][]** with *[Medallions of the Yellow Sign][medallion]*,
saying that the following and learning from the sign will teach them the truths of the world.

The **[Players][]** can now enter the temple.
Upon investigating the temple they find more homage to the God of No Name.
They also find information about the pillars.
