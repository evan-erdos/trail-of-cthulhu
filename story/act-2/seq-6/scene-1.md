Once the PCs escape the boat in which they were detained they find themselves at the docks. The PCs can see 3 boatsheds which are accessible by the walkways.

“As you make your way out you smell the saltiness of the humid air, the boat seems to be a veritable floating steel prison; intricate stone masonry adorn its helm depicting a woman with her arms spread. There is an inscription at the bottom of her statue – what is above, so is below. You find yourself at the docks, it is here that an eerie red mist seems to be rising and the boats seem to be slowly rising higher as well. There are three boatsheds visible in the vicinity and the pathways leading are wet seemingly from the waves. A light from the patrol is visible but no exit back to safe land is, the docks seem to be detached from land and the rising red mist does not seem to help with the reduced visibility. The patrol seems to be strong however the mist has reduced their visibility and creating somewhat of a disorientation. ”
--
An Outdoorsman/Forensics in party will be able to recognize that some of the liquid on the bridges and docks is not human and is far more viscous.
A generic Sense Trouble spend will alert the group to a patrol nearby, it will also show that a group of children had been dragged without the trail pointing in a specific direction and with further details eluding the party. A follow up spend of Biology/Forensics/Sense Trouble/Streetwise will provide a specific number of 70 the same number that the Colonel wanted to sacrifice for his ritual.
A Biology spend will show both the liquid on the docks and that it is related to that used by squids.
Any Forensic/Biology/Chemistry/Sense Trouble/Outdoorsman spend on the red mist in particular will lead to realizing that the redness is caused by oxidized Iron salts.
The three boatsheds:
A Chemistry 1 spend shows that a trail of salts lead to one of the boatsheds that is painted green. A red boatshed distinctly smells of iron which can be detected with a specific Sense Trouble 1 spend. With an Architecture 1 or an Archaeology 1 spend the last boatshed is shown to be made from stone and is dated to a period before Egyptian civilization.
--
Dallying too long without an investigation of either the docks themselves with the above mentioned results or the boatsheds will cause a patrol of pirates to occur. These patrols are hostile and will attack. The party can choose to fight or flee. If they fight, the patrol will not kill them but will always attempt to capture them and take them to a boatshed costing Athletics 1 from each member to come lose, if they flee then they end up at any of the three boatsheds.
“You spot a patrol approaching……. They seem to be giving off a killing intent… ”
--
Also the party may spend as a group Sneak (2) and Athletics (2) and Interrogate to question a member of the patrol. This will give them information about how the docks they are on are not connected to the land and that the Colonel has gone into one of the boatsheds. The patrol member will not remember which one and will claim that the Colonel had been to all three.
--
If the party decides to explore the Green Boatshed:
“This boatshed has a trail of salt leading to it and smells strongly of the salty ocean breeze. Inside of it you find the heaps of skin mounted on various spikes and barrels of salt, there seems to be bits of burnt flesh stuck to some kind of contraption. There are large hieroglyphic words written on the wall opposite the door.
Below these words is a table with spread of sheets and notes, using the same hieroglyphic words. Some of them are crumpled as though someone had become frustrated with them, others have words crossed out and scribbles that are scratched over like a child using a black crayon. Some of the notes are legible and seem to be similar to some of the writings in the professor’s journal. Although the writing seems to contain a mix of two different languages. “
Everyone in the party needs to make a Stability and Sanity roll of 3 due to the horrific-ness of the scene, except those who have Sanity less than 4 they only need to make Stability rolls of 3 as to them this is expected.
Examining the Salt with Chemistry/Forensics will show that it is salt made from the basic ashes of bone (calcium oxides) mixed with organic acids (acids found in digestive systems of fish and cows primarily)
Examining the Skin with Biology/Forensics show that they belong to humans and sea mammals both.
The flesh stuck to the contraptions with Biology/Chemistry/Forensics seems to be the remnants of flaying humans alive.
A spend of Language/Literature (non-specific) will recognize one of the languages used in the writing on the notes and wall as Greek. The other seems to be a mix of Egyptian and Greek and is not decipherable, however due to its closeness to Greek, if more documents are found these may be deciphered. On the wall only a part is decipherable ‘first: three parts: Salt’.
If this is the second boatshed they are looking at and have already seen the Red Boatshed then the unknown language Phoenician and the words on the wall read
“The first truth in the ritual of three: Salt is what remains of us.”
Using Evidence Collection the party can keep the bone salts.
--
If the party decides to investigate the Red Boatshed:
“The red boatshed is filled with the smell of rusty iron, if one were not seeing the sealed transparent barrels of red liquid in front of them it would smell like basil-pesto or even spinach (which are all iron rich). There are dry husks lying in a heap to the side. The boatshed is pristine and a slight scent of bleach tingles the air. Across from the door are hieroglyphs on the wall with a table covered in notes underneath. The notes have the same hieroglyphs as the wall. Some of the notes are legible and seem to be similar to some of the writings in the professor’s journal. Although the writing seems to contain a mix of two different languages “
A spend of Language/Literature (non-specific) will recognize one of the languages used in the writing on the notes and wall as Egyptian. The other seems to be a mix of Egyptian and Greek and is not decipherable, however due to its closeness to Egyptian, if more documents are found these may be deciphered. On the wall only a part is decipherable ‘second: three parts: Iron’.
If this is the second boatshed they are looking at and have already seen the Green Boatshed then the unknown language Phoenician and the words on the wall read
“The second truth in the ritual of three: Iron is what flows through us.”
Biology/Chemistry/Forensics show that the red liquid is indeed blood and is a mix of human, fish, and cow.
Evidence Collection can let the party take a vial of the blood.
Sense Trouble/Forensics also show that the husks are of humans, cows and interestingly no flies come near them and plants have started sprouting from them as though they are fertile soil.

If the party enters the Stone Boatshed
“Upon entering the shed you quickly realize that it is not a shed but a shrine. In the center, lit by an opening in the ceiling is a Statue of a Mermaid suckling 7 ten-tentacle squids. The Mermaid looks very similar to the statue found on the prison boat you have just escaped are unreadable hieroglyphs that feel familiar and seem to be an ancient version of either Egyptian or Greek. There is however of the doors archway lettering from several known languages present“
Using History/Archaeology/Anthropology shows that the stone comes from the same period as the shed and that the statue seems to be too smooth to have been carved by hand, it seems to be a naturally forming stone formation.
A spend of Language shows that the various lettering on the archway say the same thing:
“The third truth in the ritual of three: All that we carry forward is in Stone”
The language under the status is unreadable but can be learned – This language is Phoenician and can only be learned by going to the other two sheds and using a language spend on the notes there. Upon doing so the words are decipherable as follows:
“What is above is reflected below, and what is below is reflected above. As above, so below. - Asherah”
Using History/Theology/Language/Literature/Oral History/Anthropology will show that:
“Asherah was another name for Astarte the Phoenician Goddesses who could walk on the water, the wife of El, the mother of 70 deities of the Phoenician Pantheon and for a large time the Wife of El Elyon the father of Yahweh who later became Jehovah the Jewish term for God.”

As the PCs visit both the Red and Green Boatsheds and find both the notes and decipher the third language present in all the notes as Phoenician, they can consult the Journal in an attempt to figure out something from the notes as they are mentioned to be similar to the notes in the journal. If asked whether consulting the journal is possible the answer is ‘Yes’ and spend of Literature/History/Language/Oral History/Theology will start the following expositions:
“Journal Notes on Phoenician Naval Supremacy: {Shed visit- whichever it maybe}
In the past there was a huge storm that threatened the sea trade routes of the merchant nation of Phoenicia. The Phoenicians believed this was the battle between the gods and began to pray to them to supplicate them. A Phoenician priestess Astarte began the sacrifice of children to appease the Drowned God for power. This priestess is interesting as it is said that she could walk on the seas and was not bound to the realm of mortals. The tales also mention say she could ride giant squid like beings to battle against any Phoenician naval enemy and lived in a castle that was mostly submerged underwater.
Having researched her as much as a can I have no doubts that this priestess was an actual historical figure who later joined the pantheon of Gods for the Phoenician people, I have a clue as to what her true name may be but it seems to have been overwritten by the Greeks and Egyptians soon came to power. The Egyptians seem to have adopted her into their pantheon but it seems she was splintered into many forms in the Greek pantheon, so many that I cannot trace her routes. The advent of Christianity seems to have killed her off.

Her stories seem to exist in different forms though. While it is noted in the earliest of literature that she sacrificed people, it is later stated that she gave birth to the gods of the pantheon, later even becoming the wife of El and the mother of Yahweh. Upon the advent of Christianity while a female deity does not exist there is still tales of the Mother, which may have sprouted from her.
The most interesting part of this though is the notion of the giant squid she rode. Could this be evidence of a Kraken? I also am fascinated by the existence of a submerged palace, was this how she helped the Phoenicians rule trade. Was submarine technology founded even back then?
Journal Notes from a later Date: {Next Shed visit whichever it may be}
My investigations into the dream sickness have exhausted me and I have decided to continue my research into this priestess turned goddess. Assuming that I have not gone insane and have only begun to accept that there is more to the world than I had originally believed all I can say now is that I believed that the Drowned God was some kind of being that could be communicated to through the seas. The statement of “What is above is reflected below, and what is below is reflected above” is repeated several times. I have also seen statues of a women with her arms spread with the title “What is above, so is below”. Could this be her? Could she be somehow related to this Drowned God? The ancient god Dogon may be one of her children according to legend. Could the weird cult of Dagon know something more about this? Too many questions are arising and the answers do not seem to be based on any sense of reality….. how troublesome that this is ending up similar to my research of the dream sickness
Journal Notes from an even later Date: {Depending on how it is playing out this may be presented after or even before the visit to the Stone Boatshed. Note that this may end the part so play it based on how the game is flowing.}
There are beings here… beings not of our world… but another world… an older world… our world but older… their world but younger… she prayed to one of these beings… she loved one of these the beings… she is one of these beings… could these beings spread their progeny…. Is that even possible… The ability to walk on water and live in a submerged castle is not ours… could it be a mind game played on us…. Is it merely a dream...? I choose to believe in nothing but what is seen… if there is a submerged castle where would it… …Atlantis…. the ancient pirates that prayed to her they would know…“
After all the Journal notes are complete – following up on the last note:
“You realize that the docks are actually the top of a submerged castle“

Everyone at this point must take a Sanity test of 3
Note:
If they have been in the Sone boatshed then the segment below can play out before moving on to part 3.
The option of going to the Stone Boatshed is still open, otherwise depending on the PCs reactions move onto Part 3.
If there is nothing left on the docks and the revelation of the submerged castle has occurred move onto Part 3.
