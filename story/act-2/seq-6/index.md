With the soviets original plan all gone bust and Borst having sacrificed himself, the PCs find themselves at the docks that have now been converted into a soviet base. Here they realize that the soviets have not found a suitable use for either the chemical compound from the lab or are able to reconcile the fact that Omari had fed the Black Sea Fleet to his living submersed castle. Slowly the Soviet army begins to unravel with some of its members setting bonfires and burning heretic books and notes. A message from Dolya states that she has intel for them at their room back at the main base.
The PCs will need to sneak past and/or disguise themselves in order to get back to the main base which they will also need to infiltrate. They must remember about their insignia or they will be questioned about it which may lead to a confrontation. {Stealth/ Disguise/ Driving/ Reassurance/ Credit Rating/ Preparedness/ Sense Trouble}
At their room Dolya has left them a note and a couple of photos and a map. The note states she has gotten very close to solving her friend’s death, she mentions the photo in the note saying they might find something interesting there. The photo is that of Grigori Rasputin in his priestly garb and a prayer belt inscribed with characters around him. The location of the first photo is weird it feels like a train station but is too dark  to be one and it seems to also be an inauguration blessing event of some sort. The second photo is that of the same prayer belt at Moscow’s State Historical Museum. {Photography/History/ Theology} {The same can be found out through Library Use / History}
Dolya has also left behind the schematic maps for a train station. However when the PCs reach the station noted on the map they see ruins. {Disguise /Driving}
Sense Trouble will cause them to hear the sounds of trains and the rumble/vibrations of the trains but they can’t see these trains. {If any PC wonders out loud whether they are seeing a vision, they must take a Sanity test and must explain based on their pillars of sanity why they remain sane, using trains and train stations in their tale. }
If there is an Outdoorsman in the party they can notice that the interspersed huts seem to all form a web with the ruins at their epicenter. If the ruins are explored further a secondary sound is heard, one of rushing water. It seems to run parallel to the train sensations that the players feel. The players examine the ruins the lay f the land and the topography to realize that the railroad is not up here near the ruins but underground and that the photo of Rasputin was the inauguration of an intricate military underground railroad system for supply movements. {Geology, Outdoorsman, Architecture, Archaeology, Sense Trouble, Physics}. The party makes their way underground and can sneakily board a supply train to Moscow.
