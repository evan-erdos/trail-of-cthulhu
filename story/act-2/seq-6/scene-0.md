You find yourselves locked up in the dungeon of one of the slave ships of Omari, he has given you an ultimatum to either help him figure out the answer to the summoning or to rot in his dungeons for having ruined his trade/supply chain to the soviets and costing him a good sum of money.
The dungeon is a simple cell with 3 wood beds and a chamber pot for relief. There is enough space to pace about and Omari has only taken your weapons or anything else that may be used to deal damage. He has however left you with the rest of your belongings partly due to arrogance and partly because he wishes you to go through your notes to help him figure out the correct way to do the ritual.
There are three shifts to the guard, each manned by a single soldier.
One of the soldiers is a battle hardened soldier Sayid who is loyal to Omari and the only way through him is through combat.
The second shift is manned by an older man Massyak who seems to have a connection with the yellow medallion given to you by the tribe earlier.
{If the party have lost the medallion, then Massyak is wearing the medallion and one of the notes the party possesses depicting the medallion has caught his attention.}
The last shift is manned by a nervous child soldier Khaled who is older than the other child soldiers but has never been given responsibility before. This soldier seems to favor Khalif the child soldier you spent time with while tracking Omari. Also Khaled is constantly coughing.
The lock on the cell is a simple padlock that anyone could pick and luckily the soldiers who took the many weapons of the party did not know that hairpins could be used to pick this lock. Also any sturdy person could kick open the door, however doing so will clearly result in a loud noise calling the armed guard over to investigate the disturbance.
Time is of the essence Omari no matter what will follow through with his ritual, and while waiting is an option, remind the party of the greater goal of stopping Ilya who has made off with the mask of Hastur. Also subtly remind them that they have access to their journal that may shed light on their next steps
The following are unique to certain PC choices and can be used to shed light on things or to help them escape. As waiting is an option a path forward is provided in case they do so.

The players can combat Sayid which can be initiated in various ways, including throwing the chamber-pot at him. Combat is hard due to being locked up and him having a gun. He can however be bargained with, Sayid is interested in one of the slave girls who hates him. He will trade your freedom for a love spell, however it is a costly spend to coax him into revealing this (Bargain 2).

Further questioning Massyak (Occult 1, Flattery 1) (the older guard) can lead to a dialogue where the guard divulges the following secrets about the Kraken and its connection to the yellow sign.
“In the days of ancient past, as the men worshiped the old gods of the sea and the moon, they would perform a ritual of re-birth through drowning. This ritual is still seen now in modern times but is less of a ritual. Those who curried favor with the gods and have performed this ritual would find themselves bestowed with powers from the God of the Drowned, the one who can only be seen by men who are drowned. As they continue to serve the old ones, they find themselves turning into one of the drowned servants, those who prove themselves to the gods become the protectors of god dwelling in the depths of the sea”
(Allow a free assess honest, Massyak as speaks the truth)
Also with certain spends (Bureaucracy 1, Reassurance 1, or Bargain 1) Massyak can open the cage and let them out however he will “commit suicide” immediately. He can also be questioned using a spell from the journal he will provide the above response, release the party and commit suicide. (If a spell is used a Sanity check for 4 is required) His body can be examined (Biology 1, Chemistry 1, or Pharmacy 1) which gives the party information that he died due to salt coagulation in his lungs. His stomach contents reveal that he had eaten fish and drank cow milk before his death. The person who spent their points must take a sanity test of 4.

Khaled will talk if asked with - (Reassurance 1, Charm 1, Flattery 2, Interrogation 1, Intimidation 1, or Seduction 2). He will give up details about the docks where the PCs are located, he knows that the boathouses at the docks have something to do with the location of Omari but he himself does not know what the location of Omari’s boat is. In any case he too makes allusions to drowning but also talks about walking on water.
“The ancient gods would never drown, their mother ensured that they would walk on bodies of water protected from the bastard lord of storms, many of the ancient pirates believed that earning this goddesses favor would protect them from raging seas.”
If asked with a spell from the journal (have a PC roll for sanity check 3 in case this is chosen) he will do all above and will also release the party.
Khaled is coughing constantly and by spending (Pharmacy 1, Biology1, or Chemistry 1) shows over-hydration and a lack of salts in his body. He also seems to carry around a steel and stone brooch carrying a coughing solution which can be enhanced to help him. He will be grateful and may ‘take a break’ so that the party can (LockPick 1) out of the cell.

---

The PCs can spend (Lockpick 2) to open the padlock and everyone must spend (Conceal 2, Disguise 2, or Stealth 2) in order to escape the cell without any of the above happening.
It would be good to provide some allusions to Salt, Steel or Stone while they escape.

Once the PCs have made it out, no matter what they have learned or how Start Part 2

---

If the PCs decide to wait it out which can be a decision,

You hear a blood curling scream. This is followed by a red mist floating into their cell from any and all openings to the outside. All three guards come in yelling disparately and end up fighting with each other, killing each other off. The fight causes the padlock to break.
As you make your way out you smell the saltiness of the humid air, the boat seems to be a veritable floating steel prison, intricate stone masonry adorn its helm depicting a woman with her arms spread. There is an inscription at the bottom of her statue – what is above, so is below.
A feminine half-man half-squid with features resembling Omari can be seen making its way towards you.

Note:
- No matter what - they are put into confrontation with the Asherah-Omari see the appendix for the beings stats as a worst case scenario as without the proper knowledge of the being and the tools that come in the next parts and it is possible that they are killed off.
