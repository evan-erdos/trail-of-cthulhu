{This moves quickly as most of it is setup giving the PCs what they need to ‘defeat’ Asherah – ‘defeat’ in the sense of survive and move on…}
“With the knowledge that you are on the submerged castle, you realize that the way forward is down. You use the knowledge gained and proceed downwards through the Stone shed that is actually a temple, through a hidden door that due to your increase in knowledge has become perceivable to you.
You also learn that there are a stash of water-landing air-planes hidden in a warehouse back in Egypt, if you can make your way back.
As you descend the submerged castle you realize that the areas are of utmost interest to you as they seem to be emanating the red mist seen at the docks. A room whose door is adorned with a gold Jolly Roger, clearly the chambers of the Colonel, the door is slightly open and a book that looks similar to the professors journal can be seen through crack. A room whose door is ajar showing cell blocks of prison inmates of all kinds – alive and beaten, dead and unmoving, and fishy and scaly… rumbling sounds seem”

If the Colonel’s private room is investigated:
“The room is lush and decorated with the finest of holster covering a window which has a beautiful couch underneath. The room is filled with stone statues of utmost beauty clearly the Colonel kept some of the wares he smuggled to and from Northern Africa. Closer inspection of the statues reveals them to be of the same woman. On the wall to the right sits a beautiful painting of a Cow suckling its young under a glowing moon that is reflected in a pond near the pair. On the pool of water stands a shadow shimmering eerily. In front of the painting is a large desk on which there is a journal similar to the professor’s. It seems to have been thumbed through recently and a bookmark sits in it. Also in the room are various artifacts in glass cases as though they are a sign of power and wealth. Many of these artifacts seem to be Greek and Egyptian in nature, some are older. A dagger with a bull shaped hilt seems to shine dully. “
Art History/Archaeology/Photography can be spent on the painting.
When a closer look of the painting is taken
“The painting seems to consume. Everything goes to black, before you see again. The scene is similar to the one in the painting except, you are present as a ghost… a spirit… an immobile watcher. The shadow grows larger and from it shoots out several tens of bright lights. The moon in the reflection laughs and the shadow seems to lovingly look back at the moon, the moon in the sky however is merely a moon, a rock floating in space the one the water though is alive and it rises out of the sea. As it does you see its true form, that of a living tentacle castle. The shadow slowly changes to a woman and lovingly raises a hand out to the castle when suddenly the calf turns into a bull and charges at the tentacle castle with the force of lightening. You snap out of the vision due to loud rumbling of thunder. As you look at the painting again you see it has changed to that of a storm and a sinking ship written on the ship are the words ‘Dagon’ and at its helm is the statue of the woman with open arms.“
The person who used their ability needs to take a sanity test of 4.
If Art History/Archaeology is used on the dagger, it starts to resonate with the blood and salts (if not present take an extra spend point).

“You hear a whisper, ‘Mortal free me so I may stop the spawn of the witch from ruling the seas again. The fish-god shall never rise again! I, the storm; the raging bull; will ensure of it.’“
The person who examines the artifacts will need to take a sanity test of 4 and can either take the dagger or not.
If Cthulhu Mythos/Occult/History is used on the dagger after this it is discovered to be Phoenician in origin and seems to be a religious dagger of Ba’al Hadad the God of Storms
Evidence Collection can be used to take the dagger.
Dagger of Ba’al Hadad:
Against Humans - Blade (-1)
Against Other Beings - Blade (-2)
Using Literature/Language on the journal in the room shows it to contain several languages in the same scrawl as the professors, there is a bookmark for a page probably the only legible one
“The son will need to feed… the bull will not allow it… the beasts’ mother must be summoned… he who controls the mother will control the Son and with him the seas….
I have found it… the way to bring the mother back… all  that I must ask her… all the tales she must have… all the children she has borne…
But her spell is not to summon her in particular… no… one that warps space, reflects what is needed, by using one half, the other can be found… no matter what the half may be… no matter what the distance may be… To think that space is nothing more than a fabric in the plane of time… it is how they talked to her… to me… what is above… as is below…”
{This points to using bull dagger to defeat Asherah and then using the portal she is summoned through with Ilya’s artifact to teleport to his location}
Art History/Archaeology on the statues reveal them mostly to be of a single woman – Asherah, she has become Colonel Omari’s muse and he has realized she may be the answer to his thirst for Power. However other statues of rival Greek and Egyptian goddesses such as that of Aphrodite, Athena, Beth’anya and Ma’at are also present.
Evidence Collection can be used to take one of the stone statues. {If not specified ask the PC to specify which one is being taken}
--
If/once the PCs move into the dungeon room Part 5 starts… the keeper can attempt to redirect them to the Captains room if the keeper feels the PCs are not prepared for the Showdown with Omari and Asherah – this part can also be restructured as compulsory if necessary to allow for an easier play.
