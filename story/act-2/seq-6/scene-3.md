“As you walk into room of cells you notice how spacious the area in the center really is. Omari stands in the middle his back to you facing the opposite wall where a vertical whirlpool rages. The people in cages are screaming incoherently, those who have grown scales and other sea animal features do have a word that is recognizable in the mess of gurgling noise they make ‘Mother’. Omari has 70 children tied u next to him. As he turns to face you he speaks in a booming voice, ‘Well my friends what do think I should do, step into the vortex or sacrifice the children?’ He laughs, ‘what does it matter I do not have the other half of the Priestess. But who would have thought that such magic was possible if only I knew… I have tried to use the bone salts and have tried to use the iron in blood neither of which worked. What am I missing?’
It seems that without the third piece the whole summoning is on the verge of failure. With  a deep sigh he looks back at the portal and shoves the last of his bodyguards through it. Blood pours out and an eerie voice speaks – ‘Stone bring me stone….’
The Colonel realizes his folly and looks around for a statue of the mother he realizes that you are in the way between him and his room where a statue of Asherah is located. You cannot fight him and hope to win. With a knowing twinkle he says ‘Make way for me’”
 At this point the PCs have a multitude of options presented to them and can do anything possible… Below are several scenarios that can play out…
--
If they have the salts, blood and the statue of Asherah they can hijack the spatial portal and use it for themselves, leaving the Omari, Asherah and the castle for another day.
--
They can try to attack Omari…
Refer to the Omari Character in the appendix below for his stats.
--
They can wait for Asherah to be summoned by Omari and fight Asherah-Omari using the dagger…
Refer to the Asherah-Omari Character in the appendix for the beings stats
--
They can try to persuade Omari to use the incorrect statue resulting in a battle between the goddess and Omari and the others (they fight to preserve themselves) and the PCs can attempt to hijack the portal amidst the resultant chaos… refer to both the Omari and Asherah (impure) sheets below.
--
If previously acquired, they can attempt to use dynamite to blow the place up and then get to the airplane hangar back on land {This is the most expensive of spends… make everything doubly expensive, the use of explosives + athletics + the loss of a decent amount of health also the PCs must lose everything in the resultant explosion.}
--
They can throw the dagger along with the salts, blood and the statue (if they have all three) into the portal to pre-emptively summon Asherah (impure) into one of the pirates. In this scenario Omari will realize that he would have lost his sense of self to join the PCs in the fight against her. If victorious he will thank the PCs and send them to Moscow after destroying the submerged castle with explosives…
--
They can allow Omari to summon Asherah and then sacrifice the 70 children to the being to appease it, they can then leave, Asherah appeased will return to slumber and Omari will remain a host to the being.
--
They can sacrifice the children before Omari summons the being appeasing her and sending her to slumber Omari will fail at summoning her lose his faith in the old ways and return to being the modern Pirate smuggler lynchpin as before. In this scenario the PCs must now placate him in another way to get to Ilya’s location. Refer to Omari’s character sheet below
