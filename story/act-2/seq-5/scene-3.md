During the travel, they have a claustrophobic vision of being drowned in a well,
by pure yellow sand surrounded by 70 banners of a mermaid.
They awake to find themselves caught by Omari and his personal bodyguards.
Omari offers them a deal,
to help him gain power through a ritual,
by choosing for him as he is not sure if the ritual is completed through a sacrifice of 70 children or by some other means.
He gives them time to consider what needs to be done and sends to be locked away in a prison ship.
