The **[Players][]** began looking for the whereabouts of **[Omari][]**.
As it turns out **[Omari][]** is not very happy that his supply chain was destroyed,
or that because of the **[Players][]** meddling he had lost a valuable customer,
and this can be found out through any bartender, ruffian or ex-pirate in town.

He has apparently sent his men out to search for the **[Players][]**,
but due to the insanity of **[Borst][]** these men have mostly kept away from the known Soviet camps,
as they too have slowly turned to worship the old gods.

Upon further investigation the pirates are worshipping the Drowned God.

The **[Players][]** also realize that the fastest way to get to **[Omari][]** is to get captured,
even though they will be stripped of all of their belongings.
