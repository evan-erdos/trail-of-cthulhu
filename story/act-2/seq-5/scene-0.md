The PCs began looking for the whereabouts of Omari.
As it turns out Omari is not very happy that his supply chain was destroyed,
or that because of the PCs meddling he had lost a valuable customer,
and this can be found out through any bartender, ruffian or ex-pirate in town.

He has apparently sent his men out to search for the PCs,
but due to the insanity of Borst these men have mostly kept away from the known Soviet camps,
as they too have slowly turned to worship the old gods.

Upon further investigation the pirates are worshipping the Drowned God.

The PCs also realize that the fastest way to get to Omari is to get captured,
even though they will be stripped of all of their belongings.
