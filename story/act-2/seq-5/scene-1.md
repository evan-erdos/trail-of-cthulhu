They hear that Omari prides himself on being hidden,
and so far has only been found once,
by Ilya for whom he has done a favor in exchange for telling him why he was found.

The PCs realize that by finding Omari they will be able to ask of a favor from him.
Further investigating Omari,
the PCs hear the rumors of him being part of a Sheiks harem as a young boy.

They also hear of his unquenchable thirst for power,
and how he has slowly been turning towards the old gods as a solution for that thirst.
