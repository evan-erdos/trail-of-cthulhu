The **[Players][]** began looking for the whereabouts of **[Omari][]**.
The **[Players][]** also realize that the fastest way to get to **[Omari][]** is to get captured,
even though they will be stripped of all of their belongings.

The **[Players][]** realize that by finding **[Omari][]** they will be able to ask of a favor from him.
They learn of a dock surrounded by red mist which is where **[Omari][]** makes his home.
They also learn of a conspicuous shipment of alcohol,
going to an eerie red dock and smuggle themselves into the containers.

They awake to find themselves caught by **[Omari][]** and his personal bodyguards,
and **[Omari][]** offers them a deal.
