The PCs began looking for the whereabouts of Omari.
The PCs also realize that the fastest way to get to Omari is to get captured,
even though they will be stripped of all of their belongings.

The PCs realize that by finding Omari they will be able to ask of a favor from him.
They learn of a dock surrounded by red mist which is where Omari makes his home.
They also learn of a conspicuous shipment of alcohol,
going to an eerie red dock and smuggle themselves into the containers.

They awake to find themselves caught by Omari and his personal bodyguards,
and Omari offers them a deal.
