Act I : **Strange Æons**
------------------------

### I.1 ###
Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door,
instructing them to gather their things in preparation for the first expedition.

With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.
After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Along the way, smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the professor's jeep.
Professor Birchwell becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The PCs witness Professor Birchwell being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.
Nearly everyone appears to be sleep deprived, and some even have physical wounds.

Professor Birchwell delegates assignments to the group.
The PCs are to question the more salient locals,
to determine what they think the cause of their sickness is.
They are also tasked with finding the village leader, and getting his opinion.

They talk to a number of villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever heard of.

They find the Chieftain, and ask him about the symbol they found.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.
Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".
His son disappeared without warning, a month before the village began to have problems.
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.

The PCs gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.



### I.2 ###
The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab, again via note.
Upon their arrival, they find that Professor Birchwell has begun well ahead of schedule.
The players notice a girl they've never seen before, watching him from the back of the lab.
The professor's in a cheerful mood, and is telling "doctor jokes" to a group of students.

Right before 11:00AM, the girl in the corner walks up to the professor,
says something to him, and quickly leaves the room.

Ever punctual, the professor begins his lecture, but he's stammering.
He stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch,
and begins to talk about ethics, and the difference between right and wrong.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

The PCs hear glass shattering, somewhere on the other side of the lab.
A small fire breaks out below a fume hood.
Professor Birchwell watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.
Some students put it out, and the audience begins to disperse.

They return to the village to present the chief with their findings.
Professor Birchwell tells the Chieftain that the village has *trypanosomiasis*
(African Sleeping Sickness), however,
none of the samples the PCs analyzed corroborate this.
The Chieftain characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.
As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He stops at a bridge in the woods, and the PCs observe him at a distance.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone they can't see, on the other side of the bridge.
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the PCs, but says nothing to the man.
Professor Birchwell begins to leave, and the PCs run through the woods to arrive before him.

The PCs confront Professor Birchwell about what he did,
and he erupts with anger, almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets, and his research.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go.

The PCs awake to the sound of sirens, and flee their rooms.
It smells like smoke, and sections of the Laboratory are crumbling.
They observe some of their peers doing very strange things.
After they escape the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
It's slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.



### I.3 ###
The PCs return to the ruins, and overhear chatter about a new ritual.
They learn that the ritual is to be held in the ruins themselves, however,
They are warned that the cultists don't like "interlopers".

They arrive to find that the ruins are comprised of concentric hemispheres of rough stone pillars,
the designs of which become more complex as one moves inwards,
towards the centerpiece: a bloody, stone altar.
Directly behind the altar is a solitary pillar of rough-hewn aplite,
which has inscribed on it a strange glyph, which they initially percieve to be the sun.
The center of what they thought was the sun is actually a twisted face,
whose horrified expression is immortalized in the red stone.

The PCs lie in wait, to observe another student gaining entry to the ritual.
When this occurs, they realize that everyone in the ritual is wearing a talisman,
just like the ones worn by the tribesmen who ambushed them on the first night.
They show their talisman to the cultists, and they are welcomed into the main crowd.

As they move closer, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around the bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be "awakened".

In their attempts to learn more about the ritual,
the PCs are caught by none other than the High Acolyte.

They are told that if they perform his *coup de grâce*,
then they'll be "awakened", and in good standing with the cult.
They must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

They are all taught a chant, and are each given a *Ceremonial Knife*.
The High Acolyte instructs them to strike at the student's heart,
and sends them out to the altar.

The PCs decide to carry out the ritual.
A player wields the *Ceremonial Knife*, and approaches the altar.
The Sacrificial Student lies comatose on the altar,
eyes wide open, but completely unresponsive to his surroundings.

As the player brings the *Ceremonial Knife* down,
the Sacrificial Student begins to say their name.
His voice trails off after his heart is perforated by the knife.

Satisfied with their work, the High Acolyte tells them about a tribesman named only "The Dreaming One",
who claims to be able to communicate with gods.

The PCs set out to find him.



### I.4 ###
They arrive at the tent of the so-called Dreaming One, only to find it empty.
Looking closer, the PCs notice a hole in the side of the tent,
and a bunch of strange, slithering markings leading downhill.

Following the tracks, the PCs find themselves in a small ocean inlet.
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
Suddenly, the waterline recesses, nearly draining the inlet.

The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.
He falls hard, as if he was aiming for the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

They also find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.

Recalling what the High Acolyte told them about the Dreaming One's visions,
the PCs return to the ruins at high-noon.
In proper daylight, they observe that there's a small notch,
cut through the top of one of the pillars.
With proper alignment, they emulate how the medallion would reflect light,
and the aplite pillar begins to sink into the ground, revealing a passageway,
with a steep set of stone stairs leading down.

As the PCs walk down the stairs of entrance, they hear rumbling.
The entrance begins to collapse, and stone begins to roll down the stairs.

Now, they're a dozen feet underground, and possibly wounded.
While they're still in the dark, they're attacked by something.
It's slimy, it has tentacles, and it doesn't appear to be touching the ground.

Once they defeat the creature, they assess their surroundings.
They're in a damp, underground grotto, and they can faintly hear running water.
They explore for some time, but cannot find any other exits.

As they approach the underground river, the PCs begin to have a strange sensation.
It's like they're dreaming awake, and they feel compelled to swim in the water.

Having no other recourse, the PCs gather their things, and take the plunge.
Strange shapes flit in and out of their minds, and they begin to fall asleep.
Their dreams are more lucid than life, and they dream of strange oceanscapes,
where the seemingly flat ocean is bent and twirled in strange directions,
as if the dimensions themselves were deforming.

They find themselves in an enormous city, shaped from solid stone.
A strange, ghostly fantasm approaches them, and as it grows close,
they experience thousands of strange blips of sound,
and it feels like they're being deafened by the mental noise.
They become attuned to it, and they notice a specific phrase being repeated:

> ...ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl ftagn...

Their vision fades, and they wake up on the shore, with their bodies rearranged.
They appear to have crawled out of the water in their sleep,
and put one hand back in the water.

They find themselves in a different cavern, and can now see a way out.
Even though it's nighttime, the water is still glowing.

They gather themselves, and notice a glint shining from the shallows.
When they pull it out of the water, they realize it’s part of the *Tendril Medallion*.
Intricate symbols mark the back and the front,
however, there are no symbols in a depression along the top.
The face has notches indicating that something could be fit into it.

They exit the cavern, and find themselves along the shore.




### I.5 ###
They return to the Lab, which has been rebuilt slightly since the fire.
They clean themselves up, and they learn that Professor Birchwell is missing,
and that nobody has seen him since the fire.
They return to the ruins and the village to look for him.
When they arrive at the village, it looks like a warzone.
There are bullet holes everywhere, and villagers are bleeding out in the streets.

Among the wounded they find the girl they saw approach the professor in lecture.
The PCs learn that she is Dolya Petrovna,
a Russian Journalist working for a Soviet media machine.
She reveals that the Soviets were the ones who destroyed the village,
and that they have a hidden Observatory, deep in the jungle.

The PCs set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.
This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the PCs flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

Dolya's leg is still wounded, and she can't move very quickly.
She's taken by the Soviets, who drive off in a different direction.

The PCs follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

Having found a way in, the PCs begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

Ilya Zolnerowich and the Professor enter the Observatory.
Ilya has his men take the grimoire and the medallion from them.
Ilya orders his troops to kill the PCs,
but the professor bargains for their lives.
He concedes, and departs with his troops, taking the artefacts with them.

Professor Birchwell is furious with the PCs, and is armed.
He accosts them for meddling, but doesn't seem like he's going to kill them.
He explains that he started the fire at the Lab to destroy his research.
He's not very coherent, but asks them to join him in his research.

When they ask him about the Soviets, he becomes furious.
He reveals as little as he can about what he's doing,
and tries to learn everything he can about what the PCs know.




### I.6 ###
The PCs now know that their professor is working with the Soviets,
that the Soviets have kidnapped Dolya, who is wounded,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They return to the lab, but when they arrive, it's no longer recognizable.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village,
and there's still an attaché of Soviet troops, looking for survivors.

The PCs hide in the brush until the Soviets are through.
Trailing the soliders, they find a hidden Soviet encampment,
but cannot approach the base until it's dark.

Now that they know where the Soviet Encampment is,
the PCs are free to return to the lab.
Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking,
they realize that they don't have enough information to break the code.

However, they are able to decrypt small snippets of information.
Even though they can only make out bits and pieces,
they deduce that the Soviets are in North Africa looking for an artefact.
It's apparently very powerful, and they plan to weaponize it.

If it is as powerful as the communications indicate,
and if the Soviets do intend to weaponize it,
it could give them a critical advantage over the United States,
rendering the US policy of brinksmanship useless.

If the PCs do not act, and soon,
the Soviet Union might become the world's *only* superpower.


Act II : **The Awakening**
--------------------------

### II.1 ###
The party has regrouped in the ruins surrounding the burned school.
They survey the land to scavenge whatever resources available.
The PCs run into Borst and he has a dagger on him.
Using the resources they heal him and find out that the Soviets have caused the fire in the school.
He needs additional healing herbs from the local tribes.

Depending on how the PCs have interacted with the tribes in Act I they will have an easier or more difficult time obtaining the herbs.
The PCs might have to trade the dagger or can convince the tribes to give them herbs.
But to win their favor they will have to destroy invasive Soviet Radio Equipment.

The PCs must destroy the radio tower by using knowledge of electrical and mechanical repair.
Here they obtain a soviet radio that allows them to hear russian military chatter.

The players return to the tribe and receive the healing herbs.
The shaman tells them that the russians have sent parties to their temples and ransacked them looking for information about a mask.
He warns the PCs not to enter any of the nearby caves as they are cursed.

The PCs make it back to Borst and give him the herbs and the radio.
Borst uses the radio to tell them that the soviets have used the journal to find the location of an important underground temple.
Deep inside a cave.
Borst convinces them that Ilya will have brought Birchwell to the temple,
and must have tortured him into revealing the secrets in the journal.



### II.2 ###
The party follows the coordinates towards the coordinates they hear about on the radio but are caught in a sandstorm that blinds them.
They hear the sound of water and are drawn into a cavern with a hidden waterfall oasis.

PCs see a glimmer in the water. Upon approaching it a figure comes out of the shadows.
It’s the shaman from the tribes.
He curses the PCs for entering a cave after they were told not to.
He warns them to leave immediately.
The players kill him and then go explore the pool of water.
They find have of an ancient medallion. The first player who tries to grab it is pulled into the oasis by a tentacle,
but when he surfaces can’t see anything.
The sandstorm dies out.

After leaving the cave a solid slab of rock closes behind them.
Revealing a keyhole and occult writing.
Radio chatter catches the voice of the Professor in the background.
The PCs head to the Soviet Base, as a reluctant Borst joins them.






### II.3 ###
The players see Ilya talking to Omari while waving the journal around.
He is issuing orders to men around him getting frustrated.
Borst tells us that he wants Omari to start shipping things now.
However, Omari refuses because he wants a military escort if he is entering Russian waters.
Ilya walks into his quarters and through a window the PCs see him put the journal down.

Omari has left the shipyard and several workers are moving valuable artifacts around the camp.
The PCs have to create a distraction so that they can get the guards away from the doorway to Ilya’s quarters.
Overhearing a conversation they decide that obstructing the supply chain will take heat away from them,
and cause Ilya problems allowing them to escape with the journal.
Through either planting explosives, stealing guard uniforms and altering orders etc.
The PCs cause a disturbance.
When they do a Omari runs out of the medical facility.
The players see soldiers dragging the professor off.

The PCs sneak through the facility.
They see Birchwell talking to Ilya.
They steal Ilya’s keys and attempt to enter his quarters.
They are confronted by a guard outside.
Through questioning they find out that Ilya has been unable to get inside the cave and it has put him in a terrible mood.

The party grabs the journal.
They also see Dolya chained to a metal radiator on the corner of the room, unable to escape.
Questioning her and then convincing her to join the party,
she tells them that they must first go into her room and get an artifact she took out of Ilya’s pocket...
half a Medallion the players leave the room.

PCs can search around and learn more about Dolya and her intentions.
Find the Medallion, and return to Ilya’s Quarters.

The players release Dolya and leave the building.


### II.4 ###
Omari pulls up in a truck and is convinced that the PCs are the reinforcements that Ilya ordered.
Omari tells them that they are headed to the cave to carry new goods to the docks.
But first must get supplies from his ship.

The player characters arrive on the docks and see children hauling boxes of goods while others guard over them with weapons.
Omari calls them his children, and explains that they deserve better than the lives they have- and that he provides for them.

On the docks a child slips and drops a precious vase.
Omari flies into a fit of anger and tells the PCs they must punish this child while he secures military escort.
Omari points at his boat and tells them to take the child to the Crew's Quarters.

The child obediently leads the party into the crews quarters where several children are sitting around looking exhausted.
A guard stands at the ready eyeing the group.
The PCs must decide whether or not to beat the child or overpower the guard and question the children locked down there.
Either way they will learn about Omari’s Food Storage, a place of leverage he uses to keep children working for him.
The children say that Omari keeps his most important maps inside and that all the Soviet documents are inside.

The PCs leave the boat and head to the Food Storage aiming to rescue the papers or feed the children so they might turn on Omari.
The food shortage is closed with a special lock requiring a key.
While there Omari shows up and begins to question their reason for being at the Food Storage.
The players can use this as a way to learn more about Omari and the child labor camp he runs.



### II.5 ###
The truck comes to a halt amidst a massive ship blocking it’s path.
The ship is covered in rust and wet to the touch.
Barnacles and strange slime ooze from it’s pores.
Omari tells the PCs that the truck has stalled and that they need to find some parts to get it working.
The PCs pan out and look around.
Upon closer inspection they see that the ship is Omari’s but seems to be it from a different time.
The graveyard of T-34 tanks hides some gears and engine parts Omari can use to fix the truck.

Horrible rituals have been performed inside the ship.
Further exploration finds that the Captain’s Quarters are filled with the bodies of sacrificed children.
Inside they find a letter written by Omari to Ilya about a shipment.
It is dated 3 weeks in the future.
It mentions a holding cell full of lockers in the Crew’s Quarters.

Inside lockers the PCs find skeletons wearing their same attire, their bodies from another dimension.
They also find a rusty key.

After returning from the ship Omari asks them what they found.
Omari then takes the party to the cave.





### II.6 ###
The party rolls up to the cave and instantly Ilya recognizes them.
He pulls the pendant off of Dolya’s neck and searches the PCs,
taking the other half of the medallion.
Ilya’s soldier place the completed Medallion in the keyhole and a yellow gas leaks out causing serious burns, blisters and popping warts.
One soldier runs into the caves.
Ilya forces the PC into the cave after him by gunpoint.
He tells them that if they make it out alive he will let them and Birchwell leave.

The party searches for clues as to where the soldier went.
They find his arm decapitated and covered in barnacles.
They also find his gun.
After picking it up Ilya sends two soldiers after them.
Through dialogue or force the PCs deal with them and go deeper inside to find the soldier.

The soldier is inside the main chamber hiding behind a pillar.
A strange contraption lies dormant.
Using dialogue the players must coerce the dying soldier to giving them the handle to this contraption, which he is using as a temporary arm in his disillusioned state.
There are other ways to get to the bottom floor involving a giant statue puzzle.

The lower level has a pool of water that reflects a version of the sky.
It is missing the ‘cancer’ constellation.
In the next room the party finds 3 statues including a crab, a bull, and a warped version of a child suckling it’s mother’s teet.
The players use the crab statue (which fires projectiles) to destroy the other statues and gain access to a throne in the center of a void.
On the ceiling in an intricate mosaic is a mask.





### II.7 ###
The sound of the destroyed statues causes the russians to attack from above and enter the cave.
There entrance through the ceiling causes the mask to fall and drop down.
Ilya gets the mask and puts it on transforming himself as yellow mist fills the room.
The mist kills the soldiers combining them into a giant flesh monster.
The players fight the monster killing it, but causing the ceiling to collapse.
They escape through a hidden chamber underneath the throne.

The hidden chamber has a timeline of Hastur that shows even into the future.
It also has references to an ancient god named Cthulhu.
The party analyzes this and exits into the chamber where Ilya found the first half of the Medallion and left Borst for dead.

The party regroups and decides how they are going to follow Ilya and get the mask and their professor back.




Act III : **Chasing the Yellow King**
-------------------------------------


### III.1 ###
Having lost the Yellow mask to Ilya the PCs must now leave the cave and come back out into the area surrounding the cave where the soviets have left leaving behind a half burned campsite.

Sense Trouble shows that they were in a hurry to leave.
PCs can use their abilities to investigate the half burned camp which is no longer as secure as before.

The PCs must spend time here to try to pinpoint the location of Ilya’s whereabouts and why the mask was more important than the monster Architecture/Archaeology/History can be used to discover that the camp was setup on the ruins.

Oral History/Anthropology show that the village worshipped not the God they had been led to believe, but rather a God of No Name.
Further investigation shows that they also worshipped several other gods over the time all that they call the sons of the God of No Name.
Dolya mentions hearing that from the tribes in the regions.
Literature/Language helps in discovering documents of a hidden camp site near the tribal village from the first act.
It seems to be a temple to this God with No Name they had been excavating.

To get there they must commandeer a damaged car (Borst can drive the car).
The party may stumble upon some ruins that hint at the existence of other gods in the region that have been sealed away.
Before moving on they are also chased by Soviets who are attempting to destroy what is left of the other bases.
These Soviets can be dealt with or tracked to a different base that has artifacts pointing to a War between a Sea God and Storm God as well as Lore about the God of No Name and his priestess on Earth.

At the temple there is a well-hidden Soviet base that they had not seen before because of lack of information.
Investigating the soviet base leads to the discovery of the professor who seems to have been experimented on.

Interrogating him with his spell-book/journal leads him to talk sometimes coherently and sometimes incoherently, depending on the overall sanity of the Party.
He does mention about the King with the Yellow mask during times ancient being the same as the God of No Name.
He also mentions the Yellow one could not find his other half, and that it angered him to no end.
Investigating the manuscripts leads to the PCs discovering that it was not a biological sleep disturbing sickness that the professor and Ilya were interested in.
Those were merely side-effects of a dream-based hypnosis.

At this point the PCs are ambushed by the natives.




### III.2 ###
The natives who ambush the PCs can either be fought or negotiated with,
fighting leads to a loss of a vital meeting with the tribal leader and a continuation of the journey from the mid-point of the sequence.
If negotiated with the tribal people take the PCs to their leader,
who then bestows upon them some Occult and Cthulhu mythos (Sanity check required).

During the journey to the tribal leader the PCs are provided with evidence from the tribesman that shows a different side to a lot of what has been told to them by the professor in Act 1.

Dolya and Borst have an argument on the role of the soviets and who should be blamed for the death of so many tribes and the PCs must decide who is right.
The relationship with the other is fractured. (Let us say they pick Dolya for this case)

The tribal lord explains to the PCs that for ages the tribe has protected the world from the sealed God of No Name who seeks to rule as King once more.
He does not have clarity as to where Ilya could be taking the mask but does say that to awaken the God to his Full power the 3 pillars of space (3 dimensions) and the 3 pillars of time (past, present and future) must be erected.
He also provides the PCs with medallions of the Yellow Sign saying that the following and learning from the sign will teach them the truths of the world, leaves them with a statement of the sign will save the world of others and change the world of theirs,
what this means is left open and the tribal chief will not answer any further.
He provides them with access to the temple near the hidden soviet camp and also gives them a clue about seeking the oceans reflection as a way to the God of No Name.

The PCs can now enter the temple, upon investigating the temple they find more homage to the God of No Name and learn about the pillars.
If they have met the tribal chief and have full access to this temple they discover a tablet with a bull sigil that when looked at closely was half of a whole Mesopotamian legend tablet.




### III.3 ###
In order to investigate the tablet further the PCs bring it back to the hidden soviet camp.
Using academic abilities to study it will allow them to see a vision of a Moon, Sea, Priestess, Storm, Yellow masked king and a warrior with a bull horned helmet.

They also see a vision of the professor and Ilya talking about a bull, which has been killed and stored somewhere in the hidden facility.
Investigating the dead bull stored in the hidden camp (Stability check) leads to the PCs learning the bull was killed by chaining it with Iron chains to stones and slowly dehydrating it with over-salted food.

They can test various theories of what the tablet visions meant with the professor.
He reacts to things about Moon, Dream, Sea and Storm each with a tale about ancient gods and priestesses.
As he talks about these things in particular he slowly regains of some sense of sanity.
He provides clues to a ruin that had been underneath the school that has to do with the medallions that the PCs are wearing before completely losing it again.

Upon returning to the school and searching for the hidden passage to the ancient ruins leads the PCs to a lab built into a ruin.
Borst sees a picture at the lab which causes him to run away in fear.
Dolya too looks at and starts to take deep breaths.
On closer inspection the picture is that of Ilya destroying a pillar of sanity of the player.
If shown to the professor the reaction is the statement of ‘How has he met the yellow sign hidden on the dark side of the moon’.
Dolya also wonder out loud what could have frightened Borst so much that he ditched the party and runs away.

Investigating the lab shows research being done on sleeping agents and drugs as well as electrical impulses to stimulate dreams.
They realize that the system was rigged to affect the whole school area that the PCs had been.

The PCs can question the professors who reveals that a lot of the decisions they made earlier,
leading to the release of the mask was under the influence of this system.

On looking into the temple ruins the Pcs discover hieroglyphs speaking of the God of No Name and the Masked King;
that all speak to a single thing - under the rule of both the God and the King people built monuments reaching to the sky – as if in homage to something.
Remembering the words of the old leader of the tribes, these monuments may be the pillars that are erected to summon the God.
One of the ruins is also show to be a pillar.
Approaching it and investigating it causes a vision of a huge being with not a clear form sometimes appearing as a dragon,
sometimes a kraken, sometimes a robed figure akin to a human, trapped in an area of void on the dark side of the moon.
The Russian Sputnik rocket is seen approaching it and a part of the yellow robes seem to transfer into the rocket causing it glow slightly.
The PCs notice that the rocket doesn’t seem to need fuel anymore. (Sanity and Stability tests)

They break from the vision returning to reality and realizing that the soviets had discovered a source of unlimited energy.




### III.4 ###
The PCs are told that the knowledge they have gained from the vision has changed them and all them must have Sanity check of 2 and must talk about their pillars of stability.

The lab now looks more like a homestead and appears to have doubled in size.
The professor is muttering ‘That which is seen is not alone, that which is heard is not alone..’
The players are now able to access various parts of the underground temple.
There are two pillars on the other side of the camp opposite the temple.
One is a pillar of space that has inscribed on it various hieroglyphs (Egyptian) that depict people using portals to teleport.
The other is a pillar of time that has hieroglyphs (Greek) on it that show the dead coming back to life as their youthful selves.
Both seem to be connected to a singular entity though.

Having looked at both of the pillars the PCs also notice a pond just beyond the two.
They will not be able to reach it and by spending their abilities they realize that it is a phenomena similar to a mirage but is not being caused by heat and light.
The shimmer is caused by darkness and upon using the Cthulhu mythos they just gained they can see past the shadow which has a yellow outline to it.

This triggers a vision of an ancient period where people move around like zombies.
They bow to a king wearing a mask, the PCs are drawn closer to this being when suddenly it looks at them.
They are broken from this vision and Dolya collapses into a heap, she then begins to float, her body tinged yellow,
and says ‘Bow to me for I am Hastur, you who possess my sigil and have protected my tomb have done well.’
At this point the professor regains a certain amount of sanity and uses a spell to stop the possession.
At this point the pond becomes a real physical pond before the party and Dolya regains consciousness with no memory of the incident.
The professor can be questioned but he has gone back to his rambling.

The pond has a temple in the middle of it and the PCs can investigate this temple to find various allusions to Hastur and how he had once ruled the land before turning into a god.
Tales of his ability to appear to people in dreams and control people through dreams are also shown.
It is depicted as many of the tribes worshipping him as a god. However the last piece of evidence is half destroyed – it is a painting with a half done god and half done man with huge blur in the middle.

As they wake up they see their professor sane again who tells them he will always be with them through the journals they have.
He also mentions that there are 4 journals and the PCs have possession of 1.
The other two were special journals that had an odd yellow covering.
Dolya mentions that she remembers seeing Ilya with one of those.
The professor smiles and says the way to the moon is in its reflection and the way to stop it may be causing ripples to divide it, before shooting himself. (Sanity and Stability)




### III.5 ###
The PCs hear a huge explosion coming from above.
They wander out of the hidden area to see the entire area of fire.
The soviets hell bent on completely ending the insanity started by the professor and Ilya.
As the PCs escape they hear that Borst has taken over the remnants of the soviets and is slowly closing down the borders and preventing anyone or thing from escaping an intended purge.
As they leave the area a widespread broadcast is made; Borst calls for the death of all of those who follow the old gods.
The Soviets also want to destroy all evidence of such insanity and come after the PCs to destroy their notes and the spell book.

Escaping the Soviets the PCs end up at a tribal village who support a different god “The Drowned God” and make sacrifices in his name.
The PCs are treated well and the elder speaks to them about the seeing the Yellow sign medallion.

The tribe however turn out to be a Cannibalistic tribe and attack.
(While they can fight they would flee for this…) The PCs flee and sneak through the jungle to a safe area, from where they can choose to go to the city or back to a camp to recuperate.

The PCs end up at the camp site (chosen for this path of the story) where Borst is burning idols and people in the name of the Orthodox Church in a flame that gets out of hand destroying much of the campsite.
He then takes the rest of the Russian contingency to the docks where they began preparation to sail back to Russia.

The players sneak into the docks and confront Borst.
They find that he had become influenced by a journal that he had unknowingly picked up at the camp as he ran out without the requisite abilities, the players extract the journal and destroy it.

As it is destroyed many of the Russian contingency dry up into heaps while others go insane destroying the rest of the boats.
Realizing that the journal had been cursed to kill off the Russian contingency in case of its destruction, trapping them in Africa with no supplies, Borst gives up that Omari whose supply chain had been destroyed in the party’s attempt to stop Ilya, is probably the only one who could help them now.

Borst however is also overcome by the effects of the Journal and as he dies he passes on a vital clue, his burning the pagan idols in the religion was no act of insanity, and he had been made to do so.
The old gods used religion as a means to continue and maintain their ethereal power even as they slept or found themselves sealed and many religious wars were merely one god fighting another.
[The Orthodox Church was Hastur’s way of fighting Ba’al the Phoenician God]




### III.6 ###
The PCs began looking for the whereabouts of Omari.
As it turns out Omari is not very happy that his supply chain was destroyed or that because of the PCs meddling he had lost a valuable customer and this can be found out through any bartender, ruffian or ex-pirate in town.
He has apparently sent his men out to search for the PCs, but due to the insanity of Borst these men have mostly kept away from the known soviet camps as they too have slowly turned to worship the old gods.

Upon further investigation the pirates are worshipping the Drowned God that the party had come into contact with at the cannibalistic tribes place.
The PCs also realize that while the fastest way to Omari may as well be to get captured by the men, they will be stripped of all of their belongings.

They hear that Omari prides himself on being hidden and so far has only been found once, by Ilya for whom he has done a favor in exchange for telling him why he was found.
The PCs realize that by finding Omari they will be able to ask of a favor from him.
Further investigating Omari, the PCs hear the rumors of him being part of a Sheiks harem as a young boy.
They also hear of his unquenchable thirst for power and how he has slowly been turning towards the old gods as a solution for that thirst.
They learn of a dock surrounded by red mist which is where Omari makes his home.
They also learn of a conspicuous shipment of alcohol going to an eerie red dock and smuggle themselves into the containers.

During the travel they have a claustrophobic vision of being drowned in a well by pure yellow sand surrounded by 70 banners of a mermaid.
They awake to find themselves caught by Omari and his personal bodyguards.
Omari offers them a deal, to help him gain power through a ritual by choosing for him as he is not sure if the ritual is completed through a sacrifice of 70 children or by some other means.
He gives them time to consider what needs to be done and sends to be locked away in a prison ship that sails off.




### III.7 ###
Having been captured by Omari the PCs are locked up on a prison ship.
While the colonel has taken any and all weapons away he has left them with their notes and documents so they can use the time to figure out a solution.

The PCs manipulate the guards to get some information about the Drowned God ritual Omari is interested in.

The PCS make their way to docks with 3 boathouses.
Each boat house has a significant clue to the supernatural that Omari has begun to believe in.
A green boatshed has Greek and Phoenician notes inside of it with burned bodies that were made into salt.
The red boathouse has blooded body husks and the blood from the husks in containers wither Egyptian and Phoenician notes inside of it.
The last one is a Stone boatshed which turns out to be a temple to a Phoenician Goddess.
At this point they may consult the professor’s notes to find out that the goddess may have been a priestess who had been the mother of Hastur’s children.
This leads to realization that they are on a submerged castle that is actually alive.

One entering the ship they can find in the Colonels quarters a painting that tells the story of Asherah, her Child and Ba’al , they also find a dagger of Ba’al, they can also find notes talking about the spell to summon Asherah to have full control the sunken castle, which is actually a teleportation spell and can be used to do any kind of teleportation, not just summoning beings from other worlds or times, but a portal that  can be connected to another point in the intersections of the fabrics of space and time.
The PCs confront Omari and hijack the summoning/defeat Asherah to take control of the portal.
 The portal leads them to Ilya’s location, but just as the shimmering space-time hole in front of them begins to forcefully suck them in, the PCs realize that, while they are all holding hands to ensure that they do not get separated as they travel, Dolya is not.




Act IV : **Can You Hear the Waves?**
------------------------------------

### IV.1 ###
The PCs wake up, groggy from their encounter with Omari,
their bodies splayed out in the middle of a damp cobblestone alleyway.
As they stumble to their feet, a faintly glowing ectoplasmic substance dripping from their soaked clothing,
they realized that Dolya is nowhere to be found.

Walking tentatively along the two neat rows of graying brick buildings that squat at the sides of the alley,
they spot a rectangular wooden sign nailed precisely over one doorway;
it is slathered liberally and unevenly with white paint and blocky crimson lettering that almost seems to scream out of its knotted surface.
On closer inspection, the PCs discover that the language on the sign is Russian,
and that the establishment below that it advertises is some kind of grocery store.

The PCs venture inside, only to find a series of rusted metallic shelves that are loosely arranged into aisles,
their surfaces populated with only a few loaves of molding bread
(the sagging plastic labels on these forgone items ironically proclaims them to be “Moscow’s Finest!”).

An old woman sits on a stool behind a banged up oaken countertop,
her hands clutched unmoving around the crinkled edges of a newspaper, her eyes unblinking and watery.
When the party asks her if they could get a look at the newspaper, she quietly complies:
from the front-page story, and from the date on the paper, they learn that:

- they have landed smack dab in the middle of Moscow,
- several people have recently spotted a yellow-robed figure rising from the banks of the river Moskva, and
- they have been shot approximately two weeks into the future.

The PCs duck back into the alleyway, and as they come to an intersection,
they notice a strange glow emanating from one of the cobblestones before them:
it’s a heavily smudged handprint, formed from the same gooey material that the PCs originally found themselves covered in.

They spot yet another of these prints on a nearby wall, and as they approach it,
a flower pot careens downward and smashes to pieces at their feet;
one of the party members notes nervously that that could have easily killed one of them, had they been just a few steps closer.

The PCs continue onward, going from handprint to handprint on a sort of trail,
which leads them right past another eerily immobile citizen with a watery, dangerous look in his eye.
The citizen begins to tail the party and they successfully lose him by hiding themselves up on an old fire escape,
but once resume their search for the next increasingly faded print,
they find themselves being followed by even more citizens with a similar aura.

Then, from a window atop a nearby apartment building,
a light flashes in a strange sequence of patterns: it's a Morse code S.O.S.




### IV.2 ###
The PCs force their way into the apartment building,
and are greeted with a musty lobby that is absolutely drenched in dark burgundy carpeting and upholstery.
Quickly, they heave a few faded couches into the doorway to prevent their pursuers from tailing them,
and make their way to a nearby elevator.
After pressing the “up” call button and waiting for a few excruciating seconds,
the paneled doors part and the party squeezes themselves inside.
The elevator creaks and groans its way up to the top floor, shuddering a few times along the way.

As the doors open once more and the PCs step out, the elevator emits one final groan before its cable snaps with a thick twang,
sending the little box shrieking down its rusty supports to the ground floor far below.
The PCs then begin the process of searching each room to find out who (or what) was sending out that Morse code signal.

After using the view from at least two of these rooms to pinpoint its source,
they break in and find Dolya holed up in said apartment, toting a rifle.
The PCs help her barricade her door with a hefty armchair to buy them some time,
and as they talk with her, Dolya reveals that she woke up in the same exact alleyway almost a week ago,
and fled to this miserable little place after she, too, had a fairly unpleasant encounter with Moscow’s glassy-eyed denizens.
She also adds that their behavior became even more erratic after a radio broadcast featuring Zolnerowich’s voice unexpectedly came on the air.

Suddenly, the group of possessed citizens that has been slowly gathering outside her door in a murmuring mass attempts to break in,
and the PCs, along with Dolya, escape by scaling the apartment building’s façade,
climbing from window ledge to window ledge, all the while evading the grasping hands of yet more citizens.




### IV.3 ###
Once they make their may to street-level, the group finds that Moscow is starting to flood with the waters of the river Moskva.
As they slosh through the water-filled streets, dodging around corners and behind mounds of detritus to avoid groups of citizens at every turn,
Dolya suggests that the group get to Radio Moscow in order to make a call for at least some sort of aid.
Unfortunately, this means that they must cross the river,
a prospect that is made all the more horrifying the moment that they trace their way to its overflowing banks.

Upon arriving at the side of the river, the PCs witness a shadowy,
slippery form burst from the depths and flail about with a screaming man in its clutches before quickly descending back to whence it came.

The PCs attempt to investigate alternate routes to the radio station,
but they find that both of the major bridges that are still above water are either teeming with nightghaunts or smashed to pieces.
This forces Dolya and the rest of the party to plunge into the Moskva and make a break for the other side,
during which they must dodge the gigantic tentacle-like being that they saw earlier.

Luckily, they reach the other side, clamber their way out of the river,
dash up to the Radio Moscow building, lock-pick their way through the brutish cast-iron door and slam it shut behind them.
The tentacle, nearing the end of its reach, pounds on the door and pulls at the building’s concrete façade, but to no avail.




### IV.4 ###
The party creeps through the darkened, bunker-like halls of the radio station,
discovering a number of rooms piled to the brim with black, monolithic amplifiers with dimmed lights and silent cooling fans,
and soundboards that are absolutely riddled with all sorts of mysterious buttons and knobs.
The floors are covered in a thick tangle of electrical cables, some of them bursting at the seams,
revealing the bloom of coppery-gold filaments stuffed within them.

One of the rooms that the PCs explore also contains a couple of microphones,
their puffy coverings chafing, the swiveling metal arms that once held them proudly aloft now drooping.
Mounted on one of the room’s walls is a plastic panel with a series of lights spread across it;
a closer look determines that this is the station’s “on air” sign, denoting which rooms are currently in operation.
Only one of the panel’s lights glows, casting out a distinctly orange hue that mulls into panic-room red around its periphery:
the tiny black letters at the center of the light matter-of-factly state “Studio 1.”

Dolya surmises that this may be the only room in the building from which the party may send a distress signal.
In a nearby hallway, they discover a moderately large slab of steel bolted to the wall,
a series of meticulous engravings spanning its surface: it’s a map of Radio Moscow.
The PCs use it to their advantage, fumbling their way to Studio 1,
which (lo and behold) contains a transmitter, its lights still flashing and cooling fans still whirring.

However, when Dolya attempts to shout out into the plastic headset, she is answered with an empty, gut-wrenching static.
The party leaves the room in a huff, and just as Dolya is mentioning trekking to Moscow Radio Centre 13 to see if someone is jamming the signal,
the group encounters a dark, flowing shape standing in the middle of the hallway, its base wriggling with formless shadows.
Zolnerowich’s voice echoes out from the shade, and Dolya tries to shoot him with her trusty rifle,
but the bullet spring from his body and falls to the floor with a solitary clink.

A tentacle shoots out from behind him, impaling Dolya through the head and writhing about in a weird burst of yellow light;
it’s as if her very essence is being sucked out.
She drops to the floor, and the PCs hightail it as the sound of maniacal laughter echoes through their brains.




### IV.5 ###
The PCs race out of the Moscow Radio building, alternately dodging the copious electrical wires that are now slithering to life,
glowing with the same yellow light that accompanied Dolya’s demise,
and hiding from the whispering figure that has just killed one of their most valuable team members.

As they approach the front door of the building and begin to pry it open,
it suddenly slams shut with yet another yellow flash, and no amount of pulling and pleading will force it to heave to.
The PCs can hear Zolnerowich’s rasping voice, telling them over and over again to surrender their minds,
that no one is coming to save them, but before he can strike them down as he did with Dolya,
the PCs realize that they only have one option left: Professor Birchwell’s spell book.

They leaf through it, discovering a spell dubbed “Spirit Siphon” with the ability to move souls from one body to another body through physical contact;
the book mentions nothing about moving a soul from an object to a body,
but with Zolnerowich almost breathing down their necks, the PCs decides that they have nothing to lose.

The group executes the spell, and the door grudgingly groans open,
allowing just enough space for a human-sized body to squeeze through.
The PCs do just that, and as the last PC lifts their hands from the door’s iron face,
the spell immediately breaks; with a shudder and another groan, Moscow Radio’s door reseals itself.

At this point, Moscow is utterly crawling with possessed citizens and nightghaunts,
and in the sky, the PCs see a ring of cloud forming around the city's center.
In the ring's middle, they can barely make out the robed figure of Zolnerowich.
The party can choose to either undertake a most likely suicidal journey to Centre 13,
or sneak its way to the center of Moscow to somehow subdue Zolnerowich’s power with the spell that they just learned.

The PCs decide to go with the latter, and they sneak their way down street after street,
avoiding the gaze of nightghaunt and citizen alike,
until they find themselves standing at the edge of the Red Square itself.




### IV.6 ###
The PCs see that the aforementioned cloud ring is lowering more and more,
completely encircling the central spire of St. Basil's Cathedral.
They also see that the Red Square is teeming with possessed citizens,
enough to totally surround them if they try to make a break for it.

However, the moment the party take a step onto the square’s meticulously placed cobblestones,
the people populating the space begin to drop dead as the area around their stomachs seem to flash with a familiar yellow light,
which then forms itself into orbs and darts its way towards the cathedral at the other end of the square.

The PCs cross to St. Basil’s and attempt to force open the grand wooden door that serves as the cathedral’s front entrance, to no avail.
Then, a single word slithers into their heads: “manners…” The group knocks politely, and the door creaks open, beckoning them inside.
They enter St. Basil's and carefully creep their way around its labyrinthine,
fantastically mural-covered hallways until they cross the threshold of the cathedral’s central chapel: the Church of Intercession.

As soon as they go inside, organ music begins to float into their heads, and when they look up towards the domed ceiling of the spire above,
they see Zolnerowich in the flesh: he floats downward, his body and face completely swathed in a loose yellow robe,
his arms outstretched in a gesture that seems to say “welcome,”
a mass of tentacles hanging from where one would expect his feet to be protruding from.

The party escapes into the cathedral's hallways,
finding various ways to stun Zolnerowich so that they can each enact “Soul Siphon” on him
(just two of these options involve either shooting down hanging lamps and chandeliers while he is standing under them,
or luring him into a bell in St. Basil’s bell tower and ringing it).




### IV.6 ###
Once each of the PCs pull off the spell successfully, Zolnerowich freezes in his tracks.
With an unearthly scream, he clutches desperately at his face and melts into a mound of sulfurous ash.
With a clank, the Mask of Hastur falls down onto the church’s brick floor.
What is more, any nearby nightghaunts that appeared during the course of the battle inside the cathedral emit screams of their own before their bodies violently fold in on each other like collapsing stars and disappear in a puff of black.

On their way out of St. Basil’s, as the group stumbles their way back across the Red Square in an aimless bid to follow the presumably now-clear path to Centre 13,
one of the PCs stops by the side of a dead citizen's body, pulls a pistol out of its grip and calmly turns it onto their compatriots.
They reiterate Hastur's words:
the remaining PCs can either submit their minds to him and possibly regain control of their bodies in the future, or die.

The remaining PCs overpower and kill their possessed friend before realizing that the only way to stop themselves from turning into Hastur-vessels is to kill themselves.
The longer they debate the situation, the more of them succumb to Hastur's influence and must be killed.

Soon, there is one PC left.

If they take too long to kill themselves, Hastur possesses them and the game is lost,
but if they do, then the game is ostensibly won; Hastur has been sealed away for at least another millennium...or two.
