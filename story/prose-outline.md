Act I : **Strange Æons**
------------------------

### I.1 ###
Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the Players receive a note under their door,
instructing them to gather their things in preparation for the first expedition.

With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.
After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Along the way, smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the professor's jeep.
Professor Birchwell becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The Players witness Professor Birchwell being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.
Nearly everyone appears to be sleep deprived, and some even have physical wounds.

Professor Birchwell delegates assignments to the group.
The Players are to question the more salient locals,
to determine what they think the cause of their sickness is.
They are also tasked with finding the village leader, and getting his opinion.

They talk to a number of villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever heard of.

They find the Chieftain, and ask him about the symbol they found.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.
Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".
His son disappeared without warning, a month before the village began to have problems.
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.

The Players gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.

---


### I.2 ###
The next day, the Players are summoned to the main lab, again via note.
Upon their arrival, they find that Professor Birchwell has begun well ahead of schedule.
The players notice a girl they've never seen before, watching him from the back of the lab.
The professor's in a cheerful mood, and is telling "doctor jokes" to a group of students.

Right before 11:00AM, the girl in the corner walks up to the professor,
says something to him, and quickly leaves the room.

Ever punctual, the professor begins his lecture, but he's stammering.
He stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch,
and begins to talk about ethics, and the difference between right and wrong.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

The Players hear glass shattering, somewhere on the other side of the lab.
A small fire breaks out below a fume hood.
Professor Birchwell watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.[^3]
Some students put it out, and the students disperse.

They return to the village to present the chief with their findings.
Professor Birchwell tells the Chieftain that the village has *trypanosomiasis*
(or African Sleeping Sickness), however,
none of the samples the Players analyzed corroborate this.
The Chieftain characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.
As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He stops at a bridge in the woods, and the Players observe him at a distance.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone they can't see, on the other side of the bridge.
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the Players, but says nothing to the man.
Professor Birchwell begins to leave, and the Players run through the woods to arrive before him.

The Players confront Professor Birchwell about what he did,
and he erupts with anger, almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets, and his research.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go, with a firm warning.

The Players awake to the sound of sirens, and flee their rooms.
It smells like smoke, and sections of the Laboratory are crumbling.
They observe some of their peers doing very strange things.
After they escape the lab, the Players pore over the notes they found.
It's slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.

---


### I.3 ###
The Players return to the ruins, and overhear chatter about a new ritual.
They learn that the ritual is to be held in the ruins themselves, however,
They are warned that the cultists don't like "interlopers".

They arrive to find that the ruins are comprised of concentric hemispheres of rough stone pillars,
the designs of which become more complex as one moves inwards,
towards the centerpiece: a bloody, stone altar.
Directly behind the altar is a solitary pillar of rough-hewn aplite,
which has inscribed on it a strange glyph, which they initially percieve to be the sun.
The center of what they thought was the sun is actually a twisted face,
whose horrified expression is immortalized in the red stone.

The Players lie in wait, to observe another student gaining entry to the ritual.
When this occurs, they realize that everyone in the ritual is wearing a talisman,
just like the ones worn by the tribesmen who ambushed them on the first night.
They show their talisman to the cultists, and they are welcomed into the main crowd.

As they move closer, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around the bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be "awakened".

In their attempts to learn more about the ritual,
the Players are eventually caught by none other than the **High Acolyte**.

They are told that if they perform his *coup de grâce*,
then they'll be "awakened", and in good standing with the cult.
They must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

They are all taught a chant, and are each given a *Ceremonial Knife*.
The **High Acolyte** instructs them to strike at the student's heart,
and sends them out to the altar.

The Players decide to carry out the ritual.
A player wields the *Ceremonial Knife*, and approaches the altar.
The **Sacrificial Student** lies comatose on the altar,
eyes wide open, but completely unresponsive to his surroundings.


As the player brings the *Ceremonial Knife* down,
the **Sacrificial Student** begins to say their name.
His voice trails off after his heart is perforated by the knife.

Satisfied with their work, the **High Acolyte** tells them about a tribesman,
who claims to be able to communicate with gods.

---


### I.4 ###
They arrive at the tent of the so-called **Dreaming One**, only to find it empty.
Looking closer, the Players notice a hole in the side of the tent,
and a bunch of strange, slithering markings leading downhill.

Following the tracks, the Players find themselves in a small ocean inlet. 
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
Suddenly, the waterline recesses, nearly draining the inlet.

The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.
He falls hard, as if he was aiming for the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

They also find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.

Recalling what the **High Acolyte** told them,
the Players return to the ruins at high-noon.
In proper daylight, they observe that there's a hole,
cut through the top of one of the pillars.
With proper alignment, they emulate how the medallion would reflect light,
and the aplite pillar begins to sink into the ground, revealing a passageway,
with a pretty steep set of stone stairs leading down.

As the Players walk down the stairs of entrance, they hear rumbling.
The entrance begins to collapse, and stone begins to roll down the stairs.

Now, they're a dozen feet underground, and possibly wounded.
While they're still in the dark, they're attacked by something.
It's slimy, it has tentacles, and it doesn't appear to be touching the ground.

Once they defeat the creature, they assess their surroundings.
They're in a damp, underground grotto, and they can faintly hear running water.

As they approach the underground river, the Players begin to have a strange sensation.
It's like they're dreaming awake, and they feel compelled to swim in the water.

Having no other recourse, the Players gather their things, and take the plunge.
Strange shapes flit in and out of their minds, and they begin to fall asleep.
Their dreams are more lucid than life, and they dream of strange oceanscapes,
where the seemingly flat ocean is bent and twirled in strange directions,
as if the dimensions themselves were deforming.

They find themselves in an enormous city, shaped from solid stone.
A strange, ghostly fantasm approaches them, and as it grows close,
they experience thousands of strange blips of sound,
and it feels like they're being deafened by the mental noise.
They become attuned to it, and they notice a specific phrase being repeated:

> ...ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl ftagn...

Their vision fades, and they wake up on the shore, with their bodies rearranged.
They appear to have crawled out of the water in their sleep,
and put one hand back in the water.

They find themselves in a different cavern, and can now see a way out.
However, it's nighttime, but the water is still glowing.

They gather themselves, and notice a glint shining from the shallows.
When they pull it out of the water, they realize it's the *Tendril Medallion*.

They exit the cavern, and find themselves along the shore.

---


### I.5 ###

They return to the Lab, which has been rebuilt slightly since the fire.
They clean themselves up, and they learn that Professor Birchwell is missing.
Nobody has seen him since the fire.
They return to the ruins and the village to look for him.
When they arrive at the village, it looks like a warzone.
There are bullet holes everywhere, and villagers are bleeding out in the streets.

Among the wounded they find the girl they saw approach the professor in lecture.
The Players learn that she is Dolya Petrovna,
a Russian Journalist working for a Soviet media machine.
She reveals that the Soviets were the ones who destroyed the village,
and that they have a hidden Observatory, deep in the jungle.

The Players set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.
This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the Players flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

Dolya's leg is still wounded, and she can't move very quickly.
She's taken by the Soviets, who drive off in a different direction.

The Players follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

Having found a way in, the Players begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

Ilya Zolnerowich and the Professor enter the Observatory.
Ilya has his men take the grimoire and the medallion from them.
Ilya orders his troops to kill the Players,
but the professor bargains for their lives.
He concedes, and departs with his troops, taking the artefacts with them.

Professor Birchwell is furious with the Players, and is armed.
He accosts them for meddling, but doesn't seem like he's going to kill them.
He explains that he started the fire at the Lab to destroy his research.
He's not very coherent, but asks them to join him in his research.

When they ask him about the Soviets, he becomes furious.
He reveals as little as he can about what he's doing,
and tries to learn everything he can about what the Players know.

---


### I.6 ###
The Players now know that their professor is working with the Soviets,
that the Soviets have kidnapped Dolya, who is wounded,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They return to the lab, but when they arrive, it's no longer recognizable.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village,
and there's still an attaché of Soviet troops, looking for survivors.

The Players hide in the brush until the Soviets are through.
Trailing the soliders, they find a hidden Soviet encampment,
but cannot approach the base until it's dark.

Now that they know where the Soviet Encampment is,
the Players are free to return to the lab.
Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking, they learn a horrible truth.

The blinking object they noticed through the telescope was sending coordinates.
Plotting them, they realize that although the coordinates are very imprecise,
they roughly correlate to the capitals of every major country in the world.

Act II : **The Awakening**
--------------------------





Act III : **Chasing the Yellow King**
-------------------------------------






Act IV : **Can You Hear the Waves?**
------------------------------------

### IV.1 ###
The PCs wake up, groggy from their encounter with Omari,
their bodies splayed out in the middle of a damp cobblestone alleyway.
As they stumble to their feet, a faintly glowing ectoplasmic substance dripping from their soaked clothing,
they realized that Dolya is nowhere to be found.
Walking tentatively along the two neat rows of graying brick buildings that squat at the sides of the alley,
they spot a rectangular wooden sign nailed precisely over one doorway;
it is slathered liberally and unevenly with white paint and blocky crimson lettering that almost seems to scream out of its knotted surface.
On closer inspection, the PCs discover that the language on the sign is Russian,
and that the establishment below that it advertises is some kind of grocery store.
The PCs venture inside, only to find a series of rusted metallic shelves that are loosely arranged into aisles,
their surfaces populated with only a few loaves of molding bread
(the sagging plastic labels on these forgone items ironically proclaims them to be “Moscow’s Finest!”).
An old woman sits on a stool behind a banged up oaken countertop,
her hands clutched unmoving around the crinkled edges of a newspaper, her eyes unblinking and watery.
When the party asks her if they could get a look at the newspaper, she quietly complies:
from the front-page story, and from the date on the paper, they learn that:

- they have landed smack dab in the middle of Moscow,
- several people have recently spotted a yellow-robed figure rising from the banks of the river Moskva, and
- they have been shot approximately two weeks into the future.

The PCs duck back into the alleyway, and as they come to an intersection,
they notice a strange glow emanating from one of the cobblestones before them:
it’s a heavily smudged handprint, formed from the same gooey material that the PCs originally found themselves covered in.
They spot yet another of these prints on a nearby wall, and as they approach it,
a flower pot careens downward and smashes to pieces at their feet;
one of the party members notes nervously that that could have easily killed one of them, had they been just a few steps closer.
The PCs continue onward, going from handprint to handprint on a sort of trail,
which leads them right past another eerily immobile citizen with a watery, dangerous look in his eye.
The citizen begins to tail the party and they successfully lose him by hiding themselves up on an old fire escape,
but once resume their search for the next increasingly faded print,
they find themselves being followed by even more citizens with a similar aura.
Then, from a window atop a nearby apartment building,
a light flashes in a strange sequence of patterns: it's a Morse code S.O.S.

---



### IV.2 ###
The PCs force their way into the apartment building,
and are greeted with a musty lobby that is absolutely drenched in dark burgundy carpeting and upholstery.
Quickly, they heave a few faded couches into the doorway to prevent their pursuers from tailing them,
and make their way to a nearby elevator.
After pressing the “up” call button and waiting for a few excruciating seconds,
the paneled doors part and the party squeezes themselves inside.
The elevator creaks and groans its way up to the top floor, shuddering a few times along the way.
As the doors open once more and the PCs step out, the elevator emits one final groan before its cable snaps with a thick twang,
sending the little box shrieking down its rusty supports to the ground floor far below.
The PCs then begin the process of searching each room to find out who (or what) was sending out that Morse code signal.
After using the view from at least two of these rooms to pinpoint its source,
they break in and find Dolya holed up in said apartment, toting a rifle.
The PCs help her barricade her door with a hefty armchair to buy them some time,
and as they talk with her, Dolya reveals that she woke up in the same exact alleyway almost a week ago,
and fled to this miserable little place after she, too, had a fairly unpleasant encounter with Moscow’s glassy-eyed denizens.
She also adds that their behavior became even more erratic after a radio broadcast featuring Zolnerowich’s voice unexpectedly came on the air.
Suddenly, the group of possessed citizens that has been slowly gathering outside her door in a murmuring mass attempts to break in,
and the PCs, along with Dolya, escape by scaling the apartment building’s façade,
climbing from window ledge to window ledge, all the while evading the grasping hands of yet more citizens.

---



### IV.3 ###
Once they make their may to street-level, the group finds that Moscow is starting to flood with the waters of the river Moskva.
As they slosh through the water-filled streets, dodging around corners and behind mounds of detritus to avoid groups of citizens at every turn,
Dolya suggests that the group get to Radio Moscow in order to make a call for at least some sort of aid.
Unfortunately, this means that they must cross the river,
a prospect that is made all the more horrifying the moment that they trace their way to its overflowing banks.
Upon arriving at the side of the river, the PCs witness a shadowy,
slippery form burst from the depths and flail about with a screaming man in its clutches before quickly descending back to whence it came.
The PCs attempt to investigate alternate routes to the radio station,
but they find that both of the major bridges that are still above water are either teeming with nightghaunts or smashed to pieces.
This forces Dolya and the rest of the party to plunge into the Moskva and make a break for the other side,
during which they must dodge the gigantic tentacle-like being that they saw earlier.
Luckily, they reach the other side, clamber their way out of the river,
dash up to the Radio Moscow building, lock-pick their way through the brutish cast-iron door and slam it shut behind them.
The tentacle, nearing the end of its reach, pounds on the door and pulls at the building’s concrete façade, but to no avail.

---



### IV.4 ###
The party creeps through the darkened, bunker-like halls of the radio station,
discovering a number of rooms piled to the brim with black, monolithic amplifiers with dimmed lights and silent cooling fans,
and soundboards that are absolutely riddled with all sorts of mysterious buttons and knobs.
The floors are covered in a thick tangle of electrical cables, some of them bursting at the seams,
revealing the bloom of coppery-gold filaments stuffed within them.
One of the rooms that the PCs explore also contains a couple of microphones,
their puffy coverings chafing, the swiveling metal arms that once held them proudly aloft now drooping.
Mounted on one of the room’s walls is a plastic panel with a series of lights spread across it;
a closer look determines that this is the station’s “on air” sign, denoting which rooms are currently in operation.
Only one of the panel’s lights glows, casting out a distinctly orange hue that mulls into panic-room red around its periphery:
the tiny black letters at the center of the light matter-of-factly state “Studio 1.”
Dolya surmises that this may be the only room in the building from which the party may send a distress signal.
In a nearby hallway, they discover a moderately large slab of steel bolted to the wall,
a series of meticulous engravings spanning its surface: it’s a map of Radio Moscow.
The PCs use it to their advantage, fumbling their way to Studio 1,
which (lo and behold) contains a transmitter, its lights still flashing and cooling fans still whirring.
However, when Dolya attempts to shout out into the plastic headset, she is answered with an empty, gut-wrenching static.
The party leaves the room in a huff, and just as Dolya is mentioning trekking to Moscow Radio Centre 13 to see if someone is jamming the signal,
the group encounters a dark, flowing shape standing in the middle of the hallway, its base wriggling with formless shadows.
Zolnerowich’s voice echoes out from the shade, and Dolya tries to shoot him with her trusty rifle,
but the bullet spring from his body and falls to the floor with a solitary clink.
A tentacle shoots out from behind him, impaling Dolya through the head and writhing about in a weird burst of yellow light;
it’s as if her very essence is being sucked out.
She drops to the floor, and the PCs hightail it as the sound of maniacal laughter echoes through their brains.

---



### IV.5 ###
The PCs race out of the Moscow Radio building, alternately dodging the copious electrical wires that are now slithering to life,
glowing with the same yellow light that accompanied Dolya’s demise,
and hiding from the whispering figure that has just killed one of their most valuable team members.
As they approach the front door of the building and begin to pry it open,
it suddenly slams shut with yet another yellow flash, and no amount of pulling and pleading will force it to heave to.
The PCs can hear Zolnerowich’s rasping voice, telling them over and over again to surrender their minds,
that no one is coming to save them, but before he can strike them down as he did with Dolya,
the PCs realize that they only have one option left: Professor Birchwell’s spell book.
They leaf through it, discovering a spell dubbed “Spirit Siphon” with the ability to move souls from one body to another body through physical contact;
the book mentions nothing about moving a soul from an object to a body,
but with Zolnerowich almost breathing down their necks, the PCs decides that they have nothing to lose.
The group executes the spell, and the door grudgingly groans open,
allowing just enough space for a human-sized body to squeeze through.
The PCs do just that, and as the last PC lifts their hands from the door’s iron face,
the spell immediately breaks; with a shudder and another groan, Moscow Radio’s door reseals itself.
At this point, Moscow is utterly crawling with possessed citizens and nightghaunts,
and in the sky, the PCs see a ring of cloud forming around the city's center.
In the ring's middle, they can barely make out the robed figure of Zolnerowich.
The party can choose to either undertake a most likely suicidal journey to Centre 13,
or sneak its way to the center of Moscow to somehow subdue Zolnerowich’s power with the spell that they just learned.
The PCs decide to go with the latter, and they sneak their way down street after street,
avoiding the gaze of nightghaunt and citizen alike,
until they find themselves standing at the edge of the Red Square itself.

---



### IV.6 ###
The PCs see that the aforementioned cloud ring is lowering more and more,
completely encircling the central spire of St. Basil's Cathedral.
They also see that the Red Square is teeming with possessed citizens,
enough to totally surround them if they try to make a break for it.
However, the moment the party take a step onto the square’s meticulously placed cobblestones,
the people populating the space begin to drop dead as the area around their stomachs seem to flash with a familiar yellow light,
which then forms itself into orbs and darts its way towards the cathedral at the other end of the square.
The PCs cross to St. Basil’s and attempt to force open the grand wooden door that serves as the cathedral’s front entrance, to no avail.
Then, a single word slithers into their heads: “manners…” The group knocks politely, and the door creaks open, beckoning them inside.
They enter St. Basil's and carefully creep their way around its labyrinthine,
fantastically mural-covered hallways until they cross the threshold of the cathedral’s central chapel: the Church of Intercession.
As soon as they go inside, organ music begins to float into their heads, and when they look up towards the domed ceiling of the spire above,
they see Zolnerowich in the flesh: he floats downward, his body and face completely swathed in a loose yellow robe,
his arms outstretched in a gesture that seems to say “welcome,”
a mass of tentacles hanging from where one would expect his feet to be protruding from.
The party escapes into the cathedral's hallways,
finding various ways to stun Zolnerowich so that they can each enact “Soul Siphon” on him
(just two of these options involve either shooting down hanging lamps and chandeliers while he is standing under them,
or luring him into a bell in St. Basil’s bell tower and ringing it).

---



### IV.6 ###
Once each of the PCs pull off the spell successfully, Zolnerowich freezes in his tracks.
With an unearthly scream, he clutches desperately at his face and melts into a mound of sulfurous ash.
With a clank, the Mask of Hastur falls down onto the church’s brick floor.
What is more, any nearby nightghaunts that appeared during the course of the battle inside the cathedral emit screams of their own before their bodies violently fold in on each other like collapsing stars and disappear in a puff of black.
On their way out of St.
Basil’s, as the group stumbles their way back across the Red Square in an aimless bid to follow the presumably now-clear path to Centre 13,
one of the PCs stops by the side of a dead citizen's body, pulls a pistol out of its grip and calmly turns it onto their compatriots.
They reiterate Hastur's words:
the remaining PCs can either submit their minds to him and possibly regain control of their bodies in the future, or die.
The remaining PCs overpower and kill their possessed friend before realizing that the only way to stop themselves from turning into Hastur-vessels is to kill themselves.
The longer they debate the situation, the more of them succumb to Hastur's influence and must be killed.
Soon, there is one PC left.
If they take too long to kill themselves, Hastur possesses them and the game is lost,
but if they do, then the game is ostensibly won; Hastur has been sealed away for at least another millennium...or two.
