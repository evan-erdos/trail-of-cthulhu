Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking,
they realize that they don't have enough information to break the code.

However, they are able to decrypt small snippets of information.
The blinking object they noticed through the telescope was sending coordinates.[^sputnik]
Even though they can only make out bits and pieces,
they deduce that the Soviets are in North Africa looking for an artefact.
It's apparently very powerful, and they plan to weaponize it.

[^sputnik]:
    The Soviets were sending up devices like *Sputnik* long before the US noticed any activity.
    In this case, the Soviets lost a key telemetry satellite,
    which was relaying data critical to the operation of their nuclear arsenal.
    While crude and inaccurate, the satellites served their purpose.
    They were recording approximate coordinates of major world capitals,
    and while such data would be impossible to use for ordinary rockets,
    the Soviets were developing guidance systems which relied on Organic Control.


If it is as powerful as the communications indicate,
and if the Soviets do intend to weaponize it,
it could give them a critical advantage over the United States,
rendering the US policy of brinksmanship useless.


If the PCs do not act, and soon,
the Soviet Union might become the world's *only* superpower.
