Now that they know where the Soviet Encampment is,
the PCs are free to return to the lab.
Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking,
they realize that they don't have enough information to break the code.

However, they are able to decrypt small snippets of information.
The blinking object they noticed through the telescope[^0] was sending coordinates.
Even though they can only make out bits and pieces,
they deduce that the Soviets are in North Africa looking for an artefact.
It's apparently very powerful, and they plan to weaponize it.

If it is as powerful as the communications indicate,
and if the Soviets do intend to weaponize it,
it could give them a critical advantage over the United States,
rendering the US policy of brinksmanship useless.


If the PCs do not act, and soon,
the Soviet Union might become the world's *only* superpower.


[^0]: The Soviets were sending up devices like *Sputnik* long before the US noticed any activity.
[^1]: They don't need to be, as the rockets will rely on Organic Control.
