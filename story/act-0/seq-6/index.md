Having escaped, the PCs walk aimlessly in the jungle for hours.
Luckily, they find their way to the coast.

When they arrive at the Village, the carnage is almost too difficult to look at.
Villagers are bleeding out in the streets, shredded by automatic weapon fire.

They travel to the remains of the Lab, only to find the same destruction.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village.

They now know that their Professor is or was working with the Soviets,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They find a safe place to hide and recuperate as the sun rises.

Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking,
they realize that they don't have enough information to break the code.

However, they are able to decrypt small snippets of information.
The blinking object they noticed through the telescope was sending coordinates.
Even though they can only make out bits and pieces,
they deduce that the Soviets are in North Africa looking for an artefact.
It's apparently very powerful, and they plan to weaponize it.

If it is as powerful as the communications indicate,
and if the Soviets do intend to weaponize it,
it could give them a critical advantage over the United States,
rendering the US policy of brinksmanship useless.


If the PCs do not act, and soon,
the Soviet Union might become the world's *only* superpower.
