The PCs now know that their professor is working with the Soviets,
that the Soviets have kidnapped Dolya, who is wounded,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They return to the lab, but when they arrive, it's no longer recognizable.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village,
and there's still an attach√© of Soviet troops, looking for survivors.

The PCs hide in the brush until the Soviets are through.
Trailing the soliders, they find a hidden Soviet encampment,
but cannot approach the base until it's dark.

Now that they know where the Soviet Encampment is,
the PCs are free to return to the lab.
Salvaging tools, they work on decoding what they saw in the Observatory.

After many hours of codebreaking,
they realize that they don't have enough information to break the code.

However, they are able to decrypt small snippets of information.
Even though they can only make out bits and pieces,
they deduce that the Soviets are in North Africa looking for an artefact.
It's apparently very powerful, and they plan to weaponize it.

If it is as powerful as the communications indicate,
and if the Soviets do intend to weaponize it,
it could give them a critical advantage over the United States,
rendering the US policy of brinksmanship useless.

If the PCs do not act, and soon, the Soviet Union might become the world's *only* superpower.
