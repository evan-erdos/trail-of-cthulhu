Having escaped, the PCs walk aimlessly in the jungle for hours.
It's dark, and they don't have anything to navigate with, and all seems to be lost.
However, they begin to hear the sound of running water.
They attempt to follow it to a river or a stream,
but they never find any bodies of water, the sound appears to be coming from elsewhere.
Doing their best to follow the sound,
they eventually detect the sound of waves, crashing on the shore.
Somehow, inexplicably, they have found the coast.
From there, they are able to navigate home.

When they arrive at the Village, the carnage is almost too difficult to look at.
Villagers are bleeding out in the streets, shredded by automatic weapon fire.

They travel to the remains of the Lab, only to find the same destruction.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village,
and there's still an attach√© of Soviet troops, looking for survivors.

They now know that their Professor is or was working with the Soviets,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They find a safe place to hide and recuperate as the sun rises.
