The PCs now know that their professor is working with the Soviets,
that the Soviets have kidnapped Dolya, who is wounded,
and that the Soviets have destroyed a whole village looking for something.

They return to the lab, but when they arrive, it's no longer recognizable.
The Soviets have given it the same treatment they gave the village,
and there's still an attach√© of Soviet troops, looking for survivors.

The PCs hide in the brush until the Soviets are through.
Trailing the soliders, they find a hidden Soviet encampment,
but cannot approach the base until it's dark.
