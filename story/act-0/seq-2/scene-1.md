As they move closer, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around a bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be "awakened".

They begin to sneak around, trying to both learn about the ritual,
and find a way to prevent the sacrifice of their fellow student.

They can search the altar room, stand in the crowd, or enter the catacombs.
Being in the crowd doesn't yield much,
and increases their chances of being caught.
Entering the catacombs, they find piles of corpses.
As they leave, if they're observant, they notice a symbol over the archway.[^0]

In their attempts to learn more about the ritual,
the PCs are eventually caught by none other than the High Acolyte.

INT. ALTAR ROOM, INSIDE RUINS - DUSK

A group of STUDENTS snoop around some storerooms in a cluster of ancient RUINS.
A horrific sacrifice is beginning in the Ampitheater.
When they enter the Altar Room, they are suprised by the HIGH ACOLYTE.
He moves lightly, like he's floating around in his flowing robes.
He sways back and forth in a kind of rhythm.
Although he appears to be a native, he speaks in monotone, un-accented English.

HIGH ACOLYTE
The Yellow King consecrated this eisodos.
You are not of the awakened clergy,
you are only allowed in the theatron.

STUDENTS
We have these amulets, we'd like to be awakened.
Where is the ritual to take place?

HIGH ACOLYTE
You would lie directly to the gods?
Do not tempt the gods, I warn...

STUDENTS
We kneel before your god, we wish to learn more, and join your faith.

The HIGH ACOLYTE is still for a moment, no longer swaying.
He narrows his gaze on one of the STUDENTS, and he smiles.

HIGH ACOLYTE
Your... trespasses warrant a punishment, but you may yet be awakened.

LEE RUNGE HAMMARBURG
What must we do? I am unafraid!

HIGH ACOLYTE
You would begin with a false belief?
You do not fear my punishment?
I will give you cause to fear the great King.
You will kill for him, or I will kill you on his behalf.
You will perform the sacrifice.

STUDENTS
And if we kill for this god, you will educate us about him?

HIGH ACOLYTE
I will teach you all that I know about the Yellow King.

Having determined that his goal is to bring others into the faith,[^1]
the PCs bargain with him to allow them to perform the ritual,
in exchange for their safety, and more information.

They are told that if they perform his *coup de gr√¢ce*,
then they'll be "awakened", and in good standing with the cult.
They must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

They are all taught a chant, and are each given a *Ceremonial Knife*.
The High Acolyte instructs them to strike at the student's heart,
and sends them out to the altar.

At this point, the PCs can:

- carry out the ritual, killing the **Sacrificial Student**
- negotiate with the High Acolyte
- kill the **Sacrificial Student**, and then swing at the High Acolyte
- go straight for the High Acolyte
