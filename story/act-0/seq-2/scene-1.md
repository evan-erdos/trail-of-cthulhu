At this moment, Ilya and some soldiers begin to enter from the other side.
Ilya commands his men to stop the Professor, but he escapes into the night.

INT. SOVIET OBSERVATORY, NIGHT

The PROFESSOR has just escaped the Observatory, with most of his arcane artefacts.
The STUDENTS are in the middle of the viewing platform,
whereas ILYA and his men have just entered along the catwalk edge.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Stop! PROFESSOR!
Not fast enough, it seems.
Ah, his star pupils! Are you well?

STUDENTS
Yes, we are OK.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
That is good to hear.
What was the PROFESSOR taking with him?

STUDENTS
We found some weird papers of his.
Our lab was destroyed.

ILYA appears to be genuinely concerned.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
That is terrible to hear.
If you need a roof over your head,
I will make arrangements for you to stay at our forward base,
but first I must ask how much of your research was destroyed?

STUDENTS
The PROFESSOR has most of what we got out,
and the rest is probably burning as we speak.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Yes, but how close were you to the artefact?

STUDENTS
What do you mean?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
How is it that you are so close to his research,
yet you do not know this?
A rocket of our design fell to Earth in the area.
Your professor was trying to find it.

STUDENTS
Yes, we worked closely with him.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
So you can be of use to us, yes?

STUDENTS
Certainly!

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Good. I unfortunately have a task for you.
The rituals in the ruins, they are a problem.
I suspect that whoever is leading them knows what he has under the ruins.

STUDENTS
Is that where the rocket ended up?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
We suspect, and while it is too large to retrieve,
you need to find out what he knows, and if he intends to cause us problems.
If you manage this, you are free to return home.

STUDENTS
What do you mean?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
We are desperate, I am afraid.
It seems you are the only ones capable of picking up where the professor left off.
We would not harm you, of course, you will be like guests.
However I cannot allow you to leave before we determine what he was up to.

STUDENTS
And if we refuse?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
I will have no choice but to detain you, unfortunately.
You will be well looked after, you will not be in a prison cell,
but until we know more about what the professor found, you're all we have.
If we find more qualified researchers, you will of course be released.
I do not want to endanger your lives, these are not matters for such young people.

STUDENTS
What are we supposed to do?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Find the cultist they call "The Dreaming One",
and see if he knows anything about our rocket.

The PCs are escorted out, and as promised,
are given a place to stay in the makeshift Soviet base near the Village.
