The PCs set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
It's muggy, there's bugs everywhere, and Dolya's wounds still haven't healed.

After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.

This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the PCs flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

Dolya's leg is still wounded, and she can't move very quickly.
She's taken by the Soviets, who drive off in a different direction.

The PCs follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

They lie in wait until the Soviets leave, and then enter the Observatory.
