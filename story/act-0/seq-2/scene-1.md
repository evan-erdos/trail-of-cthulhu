INT. SOVIET OBSERVATORY, NIGHT

After being questioned extensively,
ILYA returns to where the STUDENTS are being held.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
You are aware that your professor failed us, yes?

STUDENTS
What was he after?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
How is it that you are so close to his research,
yet you do not know this?
A rocket of our design fell to Earth in the area.
Your professor was trying to find it.

STUDENTS
Yes, we worked closely with him.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
So you can be of use to us, yes?

STUDENTS
Certainly!

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Good. I have a task for you.
The rituals in the ruins, they are a problem.
I suspect that whoever is leading them knows what he has under the ruins.

STUDENTS
Is that where the rocket ended up?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Yes, and while it is too large to retrieve,
you need to find out what he knows, and if he intends to cause us problems.
If you manage this, you are free to return home.
If you fail us, or if you attempt to escape the area, you will be killed.

	To escape, they need:
	**{ Fleeing / Stealth }** for each Player
	**-1** to every Player's roll if **{ Fleeing < 3 }** for any Player
