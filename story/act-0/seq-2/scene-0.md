The PCs and Dolya have followed the Professor down a jungle road.
It opens up into a clearing, the centerpiece of which is a grand Observatory.

Dolya reassures them that she can get them in, so they drive up to the gate.
The **Gate Guard** recognizes Dolya, and waves them through.
they notice an out of place American Jeep parked near the Observatory's main Atrium.

INT. OBSERVATORY ATRIUM - NIGHT

A group of STUDENTS enter the Observatory,
and find the PROFESSOR scribbling away in a little black book.
He takes notice of them, and stands.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Thank, thank god you're all, you've all made it out...

The PROFESSOR's voice is cold and flat,
as if it were drained of all its emotion.

STUDENTS
What's going on?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
A fire must have started when someone was working late,
or, early... early morning...

STUDENTS
You seem remarkably well prepared, professor.
Do you always pack your bags and travel to a secret base at 4AM?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
I was lucky.
I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd... I've been out walking.

STUDENTS
With a full suitcase?

The PROFESSOR gives no reply whatsoever.
He seems to have not even heard them.

STUDENTS
Why did you tell that Chieftain his village had trypanosomiasis?
We didn't find any evidence of that in the lab.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Who are you to question my medical opinion?
You pull something like that, you... you might kill us, or...

STUDENTS
It was flat out wrong, it can't be T.B.r, we're too far Nor--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
How am I supposed to trust you with m-my research,
if I can't trust you to not, not... trust that I have...

STUDENTS
That you have to lie to those helpless villagers abou--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
--You're the spies, aren't you?
You've been spying on my research.

STUDENTS
What on earth are you talking about?
Wait, you mean to tell us... you're saying there's spies? Here?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
You! You're, ah, you're right, about...
They don't have T.B.r, I made it up.
There's something very strange going on there, but...
I can't... rather, I don't know what, but... but...

They hear some vehicles approaching outside, and the PROFESSOR looks uneasy.
He regains his focus, having noticed something in the STUDENTS' possession.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Where did you get that pen?

The PROFESSOR's eyes grow very wide.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Did you take anything with you... out of the building?

STUDENTS
No, professor, just--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
You did, didn't you? That pen was in my office.
What else did you take?

STUDENTS
No, we--

The PROFESSOR draws his gun, and cocks it.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Open that bag.

The STUDENTS have no choice but to do as he asks.
The PROFESSOR takes almost everything they found,
minus a few illegible papers and the page with the glyph on it.
As he sifts through his papers, he comes across the letter that Oscar wrote.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
(smirking)
Oh my, such eloquence. What ever will we tell his family?

STUDENTS
You started this fire, didn't you?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Strange things are happening here. Things I cannot explain.
Find a way home, get out of here, and never speak of this to anyone.

The Professor gathers his things, and begins to leave the Observatory.
At this moment, Ilya and some soldiers begin to enter from the other side.
Ilya commands his men to stop the Professor, but he escapes into the night.
