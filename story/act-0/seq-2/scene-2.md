As they move closer, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around a bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be "awakened".

They begin to sneak around, trying to both learn about the ritual,
and find a way to prevent the sacrifice of their fellow student.

They can search the altar room, stand in the crowd, or enter the catacombs.
Being in the crowd doesn't yield much,
and increases their chances of being caught.
Entering the catacombs, they find piles of corpses.
As they leave, if they're observant, they notice a symbol over the archway.[^0]

In their attempts to learn more about the ritual,
the **[Players][]** are eventually caught by none other than the **High Acolyte**.

[#]: # (perform ritual => PSYCHOANALYSIS > 3)

The **[Players][]** determine that his goal is to bring others into the faith,
and bargain with him to allow them to perform the ritual,
in exchange for their safety, and more information.

They are told that if they perform his *coup de grâce*,
then they'll be "awakened", and in good standing with the cult.
They must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

They are all taught a chant, and are each given a *Ceremonial Knife*.
The **High Acolyte** instructs them to strike at the student's heart,
and sends them out to the altar.

At this point, the **[Players][]** can:

- carry out the ritual, killing the **Sacrificial Student**
- negotiate with the **High Acolyte**
- kill the **Sacrificial Student**, and then swing at the **High Acolyte**
- go straight for the **High Acolyte**

[^0]: This is what's depicted on the *[Tendril Medallion][]*.
