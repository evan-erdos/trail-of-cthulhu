The PCs have learned of a strange Jungle Observatory,
being operated by Soviet spies in Northern Africa.
Sputnik has been in low Earth orbit for a few weeks now,
and you have reason to believe that not everything is as it seems.

Having tracked Dolya and the Soviets to a Secret Observatory,
the PCs now must find a way past the guards, and into the building.
They have waited until dusk, and are along a Dusty Path, which leads to the Observatory.
There isn't much activity around the Observatory, however,
there is a steady flow of vehicles entering and exiting the area.
Once inside, they must learn everything they can about the Soviet's operations.

Coming from the southeast, there's a vehicle checkpoint, manned by 1 **Gate Guard**.
The checkpoint is run down and somewhat isolated from the rest of the area.[^gate]

After they subdue him and set up shop, traffic will conveniently become less frequent,
allowing them the time to interrogate the **Gate Guard**.[^guard]


~~~
EXT. GUARD BOOTH - NIGHT

The Party has kidnapped a guard, and is questioning him.

STUDENTS

GATE GUARD
It is OBSERVATORY, with refractor telescope in the middle.
There are metal path around inside edge,
and stairs from the paths to entrance, and up to Control Room.

In Control Room, there are lot of office... and papers, things.
I not... I lack clearance to go in Control Room, I am apologize.

STUDENTS
Are there guards?

GATE GUARD
Three guards patrol outside base, 5 minute interval.
Inside? no guards. The scientist, he does not allow these things.

STUDENTS
The Scientist?


GATE GUARD
Scientist? He is British. I have not spoken to him personal.

STUDENTS
Who is you C.O.?

GATE GUARD
I report to Ilya Zolnerowich. I do not know of where he is.
Enough, American dogs. You kill me now, for Mother Russia!

If they gain entry, but aren't able to hijack a vehicle,
the PCs must sneak into the main Observatory on their own.

They make it past the guards, and enter the Observatory.[^in]

[^gate]:
	While the **Gate Guard** cannot be reasoned with,
	he can be overpowered and impersonated.
	The PCs need **{ Scuffling / Athletics }** to overpower him.
	They get a **+1** bonus if they took the vines from the fence to tie him up with.
	If they maintain the illusion long enough **{ Disguise / Languages }**,
	they can hijack an incoming vehicle **{ Firearms / Weapons }**.
	This becomes harder if they fail to **Sense Trouble** as a vehicle is approaching,
	or if anyone in the group is particularly clumsy **{ Stealth / Athletics}**.

[^guard]:
	To get information out of him, they need **{ Languages }**.
	It also takes some effort to convince him to talk **{ Interrogation / Intimidation }**.
	This yields basic information about the Observatory, and its layout.
	However, if they ask about anything more, he claims to know nothing.
	To get more out of him, they need **{ Languages }** to understand him,
	**{ Intimidation / Psychoanalysis }** to get him to talk more,
	and **{ Assess Honesty / Psychoanalysis }** to verify he believes what he says.

[^in]:
	3 **Guards** walk the perimeter at regular intervals.
	The **Guards** are humorless, and are immediately hostile to the PCs.
	On the opposite side of the Observatory, there's plenty of foliage.
	**{ Stealth / Athletics }**:
	They get across unseen, **+1** if they interrogated the **Gate Guard**.
	**{ Lockpicking / Architecture }**:
	to open the door or find another way in, **-1** if they run at the wrong time,
	or if they don't use the foliage as cover.
