The PCs follow the Professor to a Secret Observatory, nestled deep in the Jungle.
The Professor learns that they took documents out of the Lab before it burned,
and threatens to kill the PCs if they do not turn them over.

The Professor then escapes, just as Ilya enters the Observatory from the opposite side.
Ilya then asks the PCs to perform a small task before he allows them to return home.
