The PCs return to the ruins, and overhear chatter about a new ritual.
They learn that the ritual is to be held in the ruins themselves, however,
They are warned that the cultists don't like "interlopers".

They arrive to find that the ruins are comprised of concentric hemispheres of rough stone pillars,
the designs of which become more complex as one moves inwards,
towards the centerpiece: a bloody, stone altar.
Directly behind the altar is a solitary pillar of rough-hewn aplite,
which has inscribed on it a strange glyph, which they initially percieve to be the sun.
The center of what they thought was the sun is actually a twisted face,
whose horrified expression is immortalized in the red stone.

The PCs lie in wait, to observe another student gaining entry to the ritual.
When this occurs, they realize that everyone in the ritual is wearing a talisman,
just like the ones worn by the tribesmen who ambushed them on the first night.
They show their talisman to the cultists, and they are welcomed into the main crowd.

As they move closer, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around the bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be "awakened".

In their attempts to learn more about the ritual,
the PCs are caught by none other than the High Acolyte.

They are told that if they perform his *coup de gr√¢ce*,
then they'll be "awakened", and in good standing with the cult.
They must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

They are all taught a chant, and are each given a *Ceremonial Knife*.
The High Acolyte instructs them to strike at the student's heart,
and sends them out to the altar.

The PCs decide to carry out the ritual.
A player wields the *Ceremonial Knife*, and approaches the altar.
The Sacrificial Student lies comatose on the altar,
eyes wide open, but completely unresponsive to his surroundings.

As the player brings the *Ceremonial Knife* down,
the Sacrificial Student begins to say their name.
His voice trails off after his heart is perforated by the knife.

Satisfied with their work, the High Acolyte tells them about a tribesman named only "The Dreaming One",
who claims to be able to communicate with gods.

The PCs set out to find him.
