The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab.
After the Professor gives an unusual lecture,
they return to the village to present the chief with their findings.

Professor Birchwell tells the Chieftain that the village has *trypanosomiasis*
(African Sleeping Sickness), however, none of the samples the PCs analyzed corroborate this.

As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
He stops at a bridge in the woods, and the PCs observe him at a distance.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone on the other side of the bridge.

The next morning, the PCs awake to the sound of sirens, and flee their rooms.
It smells like smoke, and sections of the Laboratory are crumbling.
They observe some of their peers doing very strange things.

After they escape the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
They learn that the Professor's research was not what it seemed,
and they notice him leaving the Lab, down a road to the North.
