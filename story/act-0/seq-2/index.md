title:  The Secret Observatory
---


They return to the Lab, which has been rebuilt slightly since the fire.
They clean themselves up, and they learn that Professor Birchwell is missing,
and that nobody has seen him since the fire.

The PCs set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.
This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the PCs flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

The PCs follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

Having found a way in, the PCs begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.
