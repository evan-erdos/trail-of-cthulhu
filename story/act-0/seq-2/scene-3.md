Once inside, they can rife through desks and drawers,
read documents, and find some instructions.
They can go up to the Control Room, or down into the Atrium.
In the Control Room, they find classified documents,
which contain horrifying descriptions of secret military tests.

To read these, they need:

- **{ Physics / Astronomy }** to make sense of the technical diagrams
- **{ Evidence Collection }** to figure out which documents are important to steal

They learn that the Soviets have attempted to use live humans as guidance systems for ICBMs.

They also notice a number of documents which relate to the purpose of this Observatory.
They find one paper which describes, in depth,
how to sync the telescope with a quickly moving object in the night sky.

Believing the Observatory to be empty, they begin the process of syncing the telescope.

To attempt this, they need:

- **{ Physics / Astronomy }** to operate the telescope
- **{ Cryptography }** to figure out what the blinking means

If they have these skills, they are able to figure it out while they're here.
If they don't, they wont be able to question the Professor about what they're up to,
but they'll still be able to go back to the lab later and decode what they saw.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object[^space] through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

[^space]:
	**{ Astronomy }**:
	Sputnik was broadcasting small amounts of information up to a month after launch.


Just as they figure it out, Professor Birchwell enters the area.

Professor Birchwell is furious with the PCs, and is armed.
He accosts them for meddling, but doesn't seem like he's going to kill them.
He explains that he started the fire at the Lab to destroy his research.[^fire]
He's not very coherent, but asks them to join him in his research.

[^fire]:
	It was also an insane attempt to drive Cthuhu out of his mindâ€¨.


When they ask him about the Soviets, he becomes furious.
He reveals as little as he can about what he's doing,
and tries to learn everything he can about what the PCs know.

The Professor gives up, giving them a final warning:

> Go back to the Lab, and stay there.
> These men will kill you if they see you again.
> Never speak of this to anybody, or there will be dire consequences.

At this moment, Ilya Zolnerowich enters the Atrium with a group of Soviet Soldiers.

While the Players are armed, they can't sustain a firefight.
While combat may ensue for a few turns,
they should be made aware that shooting isn't going to advance their cause.

When they surrender, Ilya takes their guns, the Grimoire, and the Medallion.
He then has a solider announce for him that he is going to test a new technology.

The troops push the Players onto the catwalk.
A group of students from the lab are brought in from the Entrance.
They all have a strange look about them.
Ilya lines them up, and we hear him speak a single word:

> Kill.

The instant he says this, hand to hand combat begins with the brainwashed students.

| Brainwashed Students |     |
|----------------------|-----|
| Health               | 4   |
| Stability            | 0   |
| Sanity               | -10 |
| Athletics            | 2   |
| Hit Threshold        | 1   |
| Scuffling            | 2   |
| Firearms             | 0   |

After combat, Ilya smirks, and raises his hand.
His troops raise their guns, ready to execute the students.
However, the Professor pleads to him for their lives.

Ilya concedes, but they are questioned rigorously about what they know.

To stay alive, and make sure they don't reveal that they know anything:

- **{ Reassurance / Flattery }** to assuage the Soviet's fears
- **{ Conceal }** to ensure that the Soviets don't find the documents they stole
- **+1** to each roll if:
	- **{ Languages }** to ensure they don't miscommunicate anything
- **-1** to each roll if:
    - any Player has **Stability < 5**, as this might be considered suspicious

INT. SOVIET OBSERVATORY, NIGHT

After being questioned extensively,
ILYA returns to where the STUDENTS are being held.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
You are aware that your professor failed us, yes?

STUDENTS
What was he after?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
How is it that you are so close to his research,
yet you do not know this?
A rocket of our design fell to Earth in the area.
Your professor was trying to find it.

STUDENTS
Yes, we worked closely with him.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
So you can be of use to us, yes?

STUDENTS
Certainly!

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Good. I have a task for you.
The rituals in the ruins, they are a problem.
I suspect that whoever is leading them knows what he has under the ruins.

STUDENTS
Is that where the rocket ended up?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Yes, and while it is too large to retrieve,
you need to find out what he knows, and if he intends to cause us problems.
If you manage this, you are free to return home.
If you fail us, or if you attempt to escape the area, you will be killed.
~~~

[^escape]:
	To escape, they need:
	**{ Fleeing / Stealth }** for each Player
	**-1** to every Player's roll if **{ Fleeing < 3 }** for any Player
