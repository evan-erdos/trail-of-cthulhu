Having spoken to many of the villagers, the PCs decide to find the chieftain.

INT. CHIEFTAIN'S HUT - MORNING

The STUDENTS enter CHIEFTAIN AMBALO's bedchambers.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.

STUDENTS
What do you think is going on with your village?

CHIEFTAIN AMBALO
It's those demon worshipers,
they are the cause of our plight.

STUDENTS
What have they done to cause this to happen?

CHIEFTAIN AMBALO
They have made deals with a devil,
and have brought this curse to all of us.

STUDENTS
Has anything else out of the ordinary happened?

CHIEFTAIN AMBALO
Oh, many things! One thing, there were white men in suits,
like yours, who came here from the east.

Light floods the tent as the PROFESSOR enters through the canvas door.

PROFESSOR
Hello, my pupils. Greetings, Chief.
Students, our work here is concluded. Let's be off now.

STUDENTS
We haven't asked the CHIEFTAIN about--

PROFESSOR
There will be time for that later. Come on, now!
Let's not leave the caravan waiting.

CHIEFTAIN AMBALO
You, you must end our curse! Find the demon worshippers!
They have caused the tide to change,
and they wander into our village at night,
putting ants in our... our grain stores!

PROFESSOR
I'm sure. Come now, my students.

STUDENTS
Let's hear the CHIEFTAIN out, PROFESSOR.
This could be very valuable information.

PROFESSOR
(sighing)
I will have the caravan wait.

The PCs continue to listen to the Chieftain's rambling.[^hate]

[^hate]:
    His hatred for this other tribe has clouded his judgement.
    While he may provide some insights, he may misinform the PCs.

He tells them that the strange men he saw come to the village periodically,
waiting at the jungle's edge, and watching them.[^men]

[^men]:
    The uniformed men are Soviet troops who have taken an interest in the tribe.
    The Soviets sent a rocket into space, but it fell to Earth somewhere in the area.

With some effort, the PCs convince Ambalo to reveal that his only son was taken.
His son disappeared without warning,
a month before the village began to have problems.[^son]
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.

[^son]:
	**{ Intimidation / Psychoanalysis }**:
	If they press him, they can get the Chief to talk further about his son.
    This doesn't fit the pattern because the chief's son left on his own accord.
    His son actually joined the other tribe, and is a servant of Hastur.
