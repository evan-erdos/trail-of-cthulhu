The PCs return to the main square, to learn about this other tribe.

INT. BROKEN STOREFRONT - AFTERNOON

The PCs return to the STOREKEEPER, who is still working frantically.
He looks like he's being flung around the room by some external force.
His movements are sloppy, he looks tired, but his eyes are wide open.
He repeatedly wets a rag with muddy water, and wipes down the entire counter,
leaving chunks of dirt and grime after each pass.

STUDENTS
You've reorganized the whole shop!

STOREKEEPER
y-Yes! I had to make sure... sure... Sure that people would buy meat!

STUDENTS
They don't seem to be in any particular order.

STOREKEEPER
Th-they're ordered by... thing-ness!

STUDENTS
Thing-ness?

STOREKEEPER
Are you s-sure I can't sell you s-so-some meats?

STUDENTS
No, thanks. We'd like to know about the other tribe.

STOREKEEPER
I can't t-t-ell any... non-m-meat buyers about a-any ritual if they don't buy so--

STUDENTS
We'll buy some meat if you tell us. Do you know anything about it?

STOREKEEPER
Y-yes! Villagers and some of your p-people, too, take part in it,
and th-there's another... is being held tomorrow!

STUDENTS
Where do they do this?

STOREKEEPER
A-are you going to b-buy meats?

The PCs purchase some weird-smelling meat,[^barter]
and learn that the ritual is to be held in the ruins themselves.

They are warned, however, that the cultists don't like "interlopers".

[^barter]:
    **{ Barter / Interrogate }**
    If they're clever, they can read into him, and barter with him for information.
