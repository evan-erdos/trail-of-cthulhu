The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.[^1]

[^1]: There are no matches because they're not sick, they're just being altered by Cthulhu.
[^2]: He knows what's going on, but won't tell the **[Players][]**.
