The caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Along the way, smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the professor's jeep.
Professor Birchwell becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.[^0]

The caravan continues on[^1], and they make camp just outside the ruins.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The PCs witness Professor Birchwell being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

They find that the tribesman is unarmed, but is wearing a strange necklace.[^2]

Professor Birchwell approaches them,
and asks them to give him the necklace.[^3]
The professor's reaction to their choice will be either clearly positive or negative.
If they refuse, or point out that the tribesman was unarmed, he will become angry with them.
If they play along, he will be more willing to help them later.

[^0]: The Professor's outburst is quite out of character.
[^1]: **MECHANICAL REPAIR** > 2
[^2]: **FORENSICS** > 1 reveals it to be a Talisman of the Yellow Sign.
[^3]: Later, it will be "misplaced" in storage, but they'll be on the professor's good side.
