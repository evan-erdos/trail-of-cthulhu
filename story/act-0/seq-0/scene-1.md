Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The **[Players][]** witness **[Professor Birchwell][]** being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

If the **[Players][]** approach the body,
they find that the tribesman is unarmed,
but is wearing a strange necklace.[^0]

**[Professor Birchwell][]** approaches them,
and asks them to give him the necklace.[^1]
The professor's reaction to their choice will be either clearly positive or negative.
If they refuse, or point out that the tribesman was unarmed, he will become angry with them.
If they play along, he will be more willing to help them later.


[^0]: Their necklaces are actually *[Talismans of the Yellow Sign][talisman]*.
[^1]: Later, it will be "misplaced" in storage, but they'll be on the professor's good side.
