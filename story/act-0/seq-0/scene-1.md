The next morning, they hear a knock at the door.
This arouses Oscar, who appears to have fallen asleep writing his letter.
The pen and paper clatter to the floor, but he hardly seems to notice.
He pulls out a sizable pillbox, and makes his way to the door.
He loses balance for a moment as he steps on a note that had been slid under the door.

The note reads:

![note-0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/birchwell-note-0.png)

As they talk amongst themselves while preparing for their first day in the field,
the PCs realize that they all had strange dreams last night.[^sleep]

[^sleep]:
    The influence of Cthulhu is known to disrupt sleep.
    This is the mildest effect of being in the area, but it's already begun.

With packs full, the PCs arrive at the staging ground.
There are other students, jeeps, and security guards everywhere.
They see Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the R.S.O.

*[R.S.O.]: Range Safety Officer

The PCs are assigned a jeep and are given some basic instructions.
They're told they can wander around for a short while,
but that they should be back long before the caravan is supposed to leave.

EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS - DAY

The STUDENTS are in a crowd of their peers,
all waiting around idly while the staff prepares their equipment.
Jeeps are loaded, supplies are counted, and canteens are topped off.
Although the crowd is quite noisy, CINDY can be heard above the chatter.

CINDY
I hear his mother came as far as the airport.
He asked me a bunch of weird questions yesterday, like,
I hope I can get moved or something.
The room is super icky, too, it's the top floor,
and it's always like, 100 degrees, even at night.

LEONARD
Apparently, the PROFESSOR is the smartest, like, ever.
Wasn't there like, some ethics thing when he was at--

CINDY
--Look, I don't care if he eats babies.
I'm just going to study and do what he says.
I'm not going to be someone's secretary.

The STUDENTS hear a scream come from across the staging grounds.
OSCAR, their other roommate, appears to have found a gun.
The PROFESSOR rushes towards the commotion.

OSCAR
It's... the yellow, yellow, yellow...
It is our saviour! Praise... to, it!

PROFESSOR
Oscar, put that gun down immediately.

OSCAR
The... it's ours, it tells me!
I am to be the first martyr of the Yellow King!

OSCAR raises the gun, and points it at the PROFESSOR.

PROFESSOR
Oscar, what is the meaning of this?

OSCAR
You will be taken... taken with me!
You can all be martyrs, the... the--

PROFESSOR
Oscar, tell me about this Yellow King.

OSCAR
Our saviour?

The PCs can attempt to talk Oscar down[^talk] or disarm him.[^gun]
If they succeed, he doesn't kill himself, but becomes incurably insane.
Otherwise he attempts to shoot himself.

[^talk]:
	**{ Bargain / Flattery / Psychoanalysis }**:
	The PCs can try to convince him not to shoot himself or anyone around him.

[^gun]:
	**{ Stealth / Atheltics / Filch }**:
	While unlikely, the PCs also might roll to disarm him.

EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS - DAY

OSCAR raises the gun to his head, smiling.
Suddenly, a member of the security detail tackles him.

BORST
(dusting himself off)
We're done here. Take him out of here.

PROFESSOR
Aha! Always keeping us safe. Everyone, your attention!

The PROFESSOR raises his voice, though the crowd is already well at attention.

PROFESSOR
This is... what's your name, son?

BORST
BORST CHEKHOV, at your service.

PROFESSOR
Yes, BORST! Everyone, let this be an example of true bravery!
If everyone follows in his example, we will accomplish great things!

Oscar is taken back into the lab by the security detail, and preparations continue.
