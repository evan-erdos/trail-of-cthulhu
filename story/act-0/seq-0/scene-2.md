The crowd disperses, and preparations continue.
The PCs are assigned a jeep.

~~~
EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS - DAY

A group of STUDENTS are busy at work packing daybags into their jeep.
When they try to sit, however, the DRIVER speaks up.

DRIVER
Not up front, hey... hey, you hear me?
That's where the pointman sits.

STUDENTS
The pointman?

DRIVER
Yeah, someone gotta keep us safe,
he need the best seat, know what I mean?

BORST approaches the jeep.
His accent is thick, but understandable.

BORST
You already have a... security? Or, I sit here?

DRIVER
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

BORST boards the jeep, and the convoy embarks into the jungle.
As they continue into the jungle,
BORST turns around to face the STUDENTS.

BORST
Hello, I am BORST. You are all student here?
~~~

Borst asks them about who they are, and their backgrounds.
They make small talk, but he says nothing about himself.[^jeep]

[^jeep]:
    Borst has a history with the Soviet military,
    and an ulterior motive regarding the Professor and his research.

Smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the Professor's jeep.
Professor Birchwell becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.[^prof]

[^prof]:
    This reaction is quite out of character for the Professor,
    but the PCs don't know that yet.

If the PCs fix the engine, they catch up with the others.[^repair]
The caravan continues towards their destination, driving late into the night.
Right before they arrive at the ruins, they are ambushed by tribesmen.

[^repair]:
    **{ Mechanical Repair }**:
    If they repair the jeep in time, they won't have to fight the tribesmen alone.
    If they don't make this roll, the caravan continues on without them.

After the PCs defend themselves they begin to assess their surroundings.
The fight is rather easy, given that Borst was in their jeep, heavily armed.

In the melee,Â the PCs see Professor Birchwell, cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and awkwardly fires, and shortly thereafter, the tribesmen disperse.
They find that the tribesman is unarmed, but is wearing a strange necklace.[^body]
Professor Birchwell approaches them, and asks them to give him the necklace.

[^body]:
    **{ Forensics / Evidence Collection }**:
    They can search the body and find the Talisman of the Yellow Sign.
    They will be able to find one later, but they will need it to gain entry to a ritual.
