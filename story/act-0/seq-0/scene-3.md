INT. CHIEFTAIN'S HUT, DAY

A group of STUDENTS enter the the CHIEFTAIN's bedchambers,
and ask him about the symbol they found.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.

STUDENTS
What do you think is going on with your village?

CHIEFTAIN
It's those demon worshipers, they are the cause of our plight.

STUDENTS
What have they done to cause this to happen?

CHIEFTAIN
They have made deals with a devil, and have brought this curse to all of us.

STUDENTS
Has anything else out of the ordinary happened?

CHIEFTAIN
There were white men in suits, like yours, who came here from the east.

Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".[^0]
He goes on to claim that this other tribe has caused the tides to change,
and that they wander into the village at night, and put ants in his food.[^2]
If the PCs press him[^3], he reveals that his only son was taken.
His son disappeared without warning,
a month before the village began to have problems.[^4]
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.
The PCs gather samples from the village,
and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village,
and the group returns to the lab.

[^2]: His hatred for this other tribe has clouded his judgement.
[^3]: Intimidation / Psychoanalysis
[^4]: This doesn't fit the pattern because the chief's son left on his own accord.
