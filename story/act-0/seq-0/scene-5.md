The PCs are now aware of the ritual (and it's location),
but will have difficulty gaining entry when it comes time for the ritual.

They travel to the Ruins, and find them empty.

The Ruins are comprised of concentric hemispheres of rough stone pillars,
the designs of which become more complex as one moves inwards,
towards the centerpiece: a bloody, stone altar.

Directly behind the altar is a solitary pillar of rough-hewn aplite.[^geo]

While they have learned a few things, they can't learn more until the ritual occurs.

EXT. RUINS - AFTERNOON

The PROFESSOR walks up behind the STUDENTS, with a solemn look on his face.

PROFESSOR
Are you quite finished?

STUDENTS
Yes, PROFESSOR. We're mostly done here.

PROFESSOR
I suppose you haven't heard the news then, having been out here?

STUDENTS
What news?

PROFESSOR
(sighing)
I'll tell you back at the caravan, they're ready to go.

They walk back to their meager camp, and it's more quiet than usual.
They observe the PROFESSOR'S jeep depart.
Their DRIVER looks them over.

DRIVER
You ain't heard the news, huh?

STUDENTS
No, we haven't.

DRIVER
Well... the main lab radioed in about an hour ago.

STUDENTS
And...?

DRIVER
There's no way to put it delicately...
Some kid ... killed himself, after he shot another student.
Apparently there was some trouble with him earlier, too.
I don't know much about that.
~~~

With this, they get under way.
As the expedition continues to the laboratory, they hear strange things in the woods.
Professor Birchwell instructs them to ignore it, and they arrive back at the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions,
but none of the tests come back positive.[^1]
