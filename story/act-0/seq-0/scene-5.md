After they conclude with Chieftain Ambalo,
the PCs spend some time looking for any clues they might have missed while in the area.

EXT. RUINS - AFTERNOON

The PROFESSOR walks up behind the STUDENTS, with a solemn look on his face.

PROFESSOR
Are you quite finished?

STUDENTS
Yes, PROFESSOR. We're mostly done here.

PROFESSOR
I suppose you haven't heard the news then, having been out here?

STUDENTS
What news?

PROFESSOR
(sighing)
I'll tell you back at the caravan, they're ready to go.

They walk back to their meager camp, and it's more quiet than usual.
They observe the PROFESSOR'S jeep depart.
Their DRIVER looks them over.

DRIVER
You ain't heard the news, huh?

STUDENTS
No, we haven't.

DRIVER
Well... the main lab radioed in about an hour ago.

STUDENTS
And...?

DRIVER
There's no way to put it delicately...
Some kid ... killed himself, after he shot some lady.
Apparently there was some trouble with him earlier, too.
I don't know much about that.

With this, the caravan gets underway, but it's a boring and uneventful ride.
The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions,
but none of the tests come back positive.[^test]

[^test]:
    There are no matches because they're not sick.
    All of their ailments are a direct result of being altered by Cthulhu,
    and their proximity to the ocean.

Perplexed and exhausted, they retire to their room.
Oscar's possessions have been cleared away,
let alone a scrap of paper under the bed.
The PCs recognize it as the letter he was writing the first night.

It reads:

> Dear Mom,

> It has been going good since I got here.
> I've been taking my pills, you're always so worried I forget.
> Since we landed, some of the weird voices came back, but don't worry!
> I actually took extra today, even though they make me feel weird.
> I'm all grown up, and I'm going on an expedition! I'll be researching!
> I'm exited about tomorr--

The PCs might recall that he was writing for more than an hour.
This appears to be as far as he got.[^note]

[^note]:
    While it's possible that Oscar's actions were entirely due to his illness,
    he says he took more pills than usual.
    Extra antipsychotics would make him a lethargic zombie, not a psychotic murderer.


The PCs hear footsteps in the hall, and then Cindy and Borst enter the room.
Borst tells them that they've made up another room for them in the basement.
Cindy begins the arduous process of repacking all her things.
With their things gathered, Cindy and the PCs relocate to the basement room.
While not first-class accomodations, the room is a step in the right direction.
They settle in, and try their best to sleep.
