Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door.

It reads:

> <tt>OCTOBER 2, 1952</tt>
>
> <tt>YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL</tt>
>
> <tt>TO ASSIST HIM ON TODAY'S EXPEDITION.</tt>
>
> <tt>PACK TWO (2) DAYS WORTH OF SUPPLIES,</tt>
>
> <tt>AND REPORT TO THE NORTH GROUNDS BY 0800 HOURS.</tt>
>
> <tt>THE CARAVAN DEPARTS AT 0900 HOURS.</tt>


With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.
Preparations are made, and while the jeeps are being packed,
the PCs hear a scream come from across the grounds:
A peer of theirs has taken a gun, and is waving it around.

While preparations are being made, and while the jeeps are being packed,

A peer of theirs has taken a gun, and is waving it around.
