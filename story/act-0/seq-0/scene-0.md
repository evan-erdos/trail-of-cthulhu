Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers living near late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

The PCs touch down at the Cairo airport,
and while they didn't talk much during the flight,
they become acquainted during the long bus ride to the Laboratory.

The PCs introduce themselves to eachother,
and share stories about how they got in the program,
and why they're interested in the Professor's work.

The sun set long before they arrived, and the lights are all out in the dormitory.
The thick, humid darkness occludes their view of the living space,
but they can hear strange bugs and exotic animals making noise in the distance.

INT. DORMITORIES - NIGHT

A group of STUDENTS are unpacking their belongings in their assigned room.
It's muggy, but the fan is doing a good job of pushing warm air around.
An alarming number of bugs circle the room's lone incandescent bulb.
Also assigned to their living space are OSCAR and CINDY.
CINDY has so far unpacked 5 of her 9 bags,
and is hard at work organizing alarm clocks and pencil cases on her nightstand.
OSCAR is short, somewhat overweight, and doesn't smell quite right.

OSCAR
(clearing his throat)
What's he like?

While all the STUDENTS heard him, it appears that CINDY didn't.
She continues along unpacking, humming to herself.

OSCAR
The PROFESSOR, what's he like?

CINDY
What, me? I don't know.

OSCAR
I heard you say you met him, on the bus.

CINDY
The bus... Do I know you?

OSCAR
No, I just heard...

CINDY
I've heard he's a complete loony, and--

OSCAR
--Don't say that, it's...
Crazy people are just... people, they're not... evil.

CINDY
Okay...?

OSCAR
(to the STUDENTS)
What do you guys think?

The PCs can render their opinions, if they want.

INT. DORMITORIES - NIGHT

The room is quiet for a few moments, save for CINDY's unpacking.
The fan rattles a bit, and the bugs continue to orbit the light.

OSCAR
It's not bad to be... you know...
Some people just need... help.

CINDY
What's the matter with you?

OSCAR
Nothing, I--

CINDY
(smirking)
--I hear he killed a kid on the last expedition.

OSCAR
That's ridiculous. You don't just...
just kill people... and, and go back to normal!

CINDY gives no response but an eye roll, and resumes her activities.

OSCAR gets back into bed and begins penning a letter.

Eventually, the PCs turn off the lights, and try their best to sleep.
They fall asleep quite easily, despite Oscar's snoring.
