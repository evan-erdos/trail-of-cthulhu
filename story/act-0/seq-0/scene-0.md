Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door.

It reads:

With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.
Preparations are made, and while the jeeps are being packed,
the PCs hear a scream come from across the grounds:
A peer of theirs has taken a gun, and is waving it around.

EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS, DAY

While preparations are being made, and while the jeeps are being packed,
a group of STUDENTS hear a scream come from across the staging grounds.
A FRIEND of theirs has taken a gun, and is waving it around.

FRIEND
It's... the yellow, yellow, yellow...
It is our saviour! Praise... to, it!

STUDENTS
Jeez, man, seriously?
