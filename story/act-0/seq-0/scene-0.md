**[Professor Birchwell][]** has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the **[Players][]** receive a note under their door.

It reads:

>> <tt>OCTOBER 2, 1957</tt>
>>
>> <tt>YOU HAVE BEEN SELECTED BY PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL</tt>
>>
>> <tt>TO ASSIST HIM ON TODAY'S EXPEDITION.</tt>
>>
>> <tt>PACK TWO (2) DAYS WORTH OF SUPPLIES,</tt>
>>
>> <tt>AND REPORT TO THE NORTH GROUNDS BY 0800 HOURS.</tt>
>>
>> <tt>THE CARAVAN DEPARTS AT 0900 HOURS.</tt>


With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe **[Professor Birchwell][]** being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.

After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Along the way, smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the professor's jeep.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.[^0]

[#]: # (continue => MECHANICAL REPAIR > 2)

The caravan continues on, and they make camp just outside the ruins.

[^0]: The professor's outburst is quite out of character.
