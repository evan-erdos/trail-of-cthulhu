Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door.

It reads:

![note-0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/birchwell-note-0.png)

With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.

EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS - DAY

While preparations are being made, and while the jeeps are being packed,
the PCs hear a scream come from across the staging grounds.
A friend of theirs, OSCAR, has taken a gun, and is waving it around.
The PROFESSOR rushes towards the commotion.

OSCAR
It's... the yellow, yellow, yellow...
It is our saviour! Praise... to, it!

PROFESSOR
Oscar, put that gun down immediately.

OSCAR
The... it's ours, it tells me!
I am to be the first martyr of the Yellow King!

OSCAR raises the gun, and points it at the PROFESSOR.

PROFESSOR
Oscar, what is the meaning of this?

OSCAR
You will be taken... taken with me!
You can all be martyrs, the... the--

PROFESSOR
Oscar, tell me about this Yellow King.

OSCAR
Our saviour?

The PCs can attempt to talk Oscar down[^talk] or disarm him.[^disarm]
If they succeed, he doesn't kill himself, but becomes incurably insane.
Otherwise he attempts to shoot himself.

EXT. NORTH STAGING GROUNDS - DAY

OSCAR raises the gun to his head, smiling.
Suddenly, a member of the security detail tackles him.

BORST
Ok, we're done here. Take him out of here.

PROFESSOR
Thank you! Always keeping us safe.
Everyone, your attention!

The Professor raises his voice, though the crowd is already well at attention.

PROFESSOR
This is... what's your name, son?

BORST
Borst Chekhov, at your service, Professor.

PROFESSOR
Yes, Borst! A member of our security detail!
Everyone, let this be an example of true bravery!
If everyone follows in his example, we will accomplish great things!

Oscar is taken back into the lab by the security detail,
and the convoy embarks into the jungle.
