Professor Birchwell has been sent to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by villagers who live near a cluster of late-Antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa.
He has assembled a team of students and doctors to assist him on this expedition.

Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door,
instructing them to gather their things in preparation for the first expedition.

With packs full, they arrive at the staging ground.
They observe Professor Birchwell being instructed in the usage of a firearm.
He holds it quite awkwardly, and is making jokes with the range safety officer.
After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Along the way, smoke begins to pour out from under the hood of the professor's jeep.
Professor Birchwell becomes irate with the driver,
and begins to lambaste him about coolant fluids.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The PCs witness Professor Birchwell being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.
Nearly everyone appears to be sleep deprived, and some even have physical wounds.

Professor Birchwell delegates assignments to the group.
The PCs are to question the more salient locals,
to determine what they think the cause of their sickness is.
They are also tasked with finding the village leader, and getting his opinion.

They talk to a number of villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever heard of.

They find the Chieftain, and ask him about the symbol they found.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.
Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".
His son disappeared without warning, a month before the village began to have problems.
All the other missing villagers showed signs of this "curse" before disappearing.

The PCs gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.
