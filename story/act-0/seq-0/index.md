Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door,
instructing them to gather their things in preparation for the first expedition.

After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

Late at night, they are ambushed by tribesmen.
The PCs witness Professor Birchwell being cornered by a tribesman.
He draws his pistol and fires, and the other attackers disperse.

When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.

The PCs talk to a number of villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever heard of.

They find the Chieftain, and ask him about the symbol they found.
He's confined to bed, and it's plain that he's nearly lost his mind.
Moreover, he says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".

The PCs gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none of the tests come back positive.
