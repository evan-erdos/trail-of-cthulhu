Early one morning, each of the PCs receive a note under their door,
instructing them to gather their things in preparation for the first expedition.

After preparations are made, and after the jeeps are packed,
the caravan begins to move into the jungle.

When the caravan arrives, they are met with the sight a dying village.
Villagers, clad in rags, are seen roaming the streets, or sleeping in alleyways.

The PCs talk to a number of villagers, and while all of their stories match,
it doesn't fit any particular sickness that they've ever heard of.

They find the Chieftain, but he's confined to bed and has nearly lost his mind.
He says that some of the villagers most afflicted by the "curse" are missing,
and he blames their disappearance on the neighboring "demon worshippers".

The PCs gather samples from the village, and return to the lab to analyze the data.
Professor Birchwell appears as they leave the village, and the group returns to the lab.

The caravan returns to the lab, and they begin analysis on the samples immediately.
They test against many common diseases and afflictions, but none come back positive.
