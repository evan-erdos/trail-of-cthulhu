The PCs gather themselves and their things, and take the plunge.[^1]

Strange shapes flit in and out of their minds, and they begin to fall asleep.
Their dreams are more lucid than life, and they dream of strange oceanscapes,
where the seemingly flat ocean is bent and twirled in strange directions,
as if the dimensions themselves were deforming.

They find themselves in an enormous city, shaped from solid stone.
A strange, ghostly fantasm approaches them, and as it grows close,
they experience thousands of strange blips of sound,
and it feels like they're being deafened by the mental noise.

They become attuned to it, and they notice a specific phrase being repeated:

> ...ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl ftagn...

Their vision fades, and they wake up on the shore, with their bodies rearranged.
They appear to have crawled out of the water in their sleep,
and put one hand back in the water.

They find themselves in a different cavern, and can now see a way out.
However, it's nighttime, but the water is still glowing.

They gather themselves, and notice a glint shining from the shallows.
When they pull it out of the water, they realize it's the Tendril Medallion.

They exit the cavern, and find themselves along the shore.
