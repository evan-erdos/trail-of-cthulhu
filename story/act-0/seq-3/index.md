They arrive at the tent of the so-called Dreaming One, only to find it empty.
Looking closer, the PCs notice a hole in the side of the tent,
and a bunch of strange, slithering markings leading downhill.

Following the tracks, the PCs find themselves in a small ocean inlet.
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
Suddenly, the waterline recesses, nearly draining the inlet.

The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.
He falls hard, as if he was aiming for the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

They also find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.

Recalling what the High Acolyte told them about the Dreaming One's visions,
the PCs return to the ruins at high-noon.
In proper daylight, they observe that there's a small notch,
cut through the top of one of the pillars.
With proper alignment, they emulate how the medallion would reflect light,
and the aplite pillar begins to sink into the ground, revealing a passageway,
with a steep set of stone stairs leading down.

As the PCs walk down the stairs of entrance, they hear rumbling.
The entrance begins to collapse, and stone begins to roll down the stairs.

Now, they're a dozen feet underground, and possibly wounded.
While they're still in the dark, they're attacked by something.
It's slimy, it has tentacles, and it doesn't appear to be touching the ground.

Once they defeat the creature, they assess their surroundings.
They're in a damp, underground grotto, and they can faintly hear running water.
They explore for some time, but cannot find any other exits.

As they approach the underground river, the PCs begin to have a strange sensation.
It's like they're dreaming awake, and they feel compelled to swim in the water.

Having no other recourse, the PCs gather their things, and take the plunge.
Strange shapes flit in and out of their minds, and they begin to fall asleep.
Their dreams are more lucid than life, and they dream of strange oceanscapes,
where the seemingly flat ocean is bent and twirled in strange directions,
as if the dimensions themselves were deforming.

They find themselves in an enormous city, shaped from solid stone.
A strange, ghostly fantasm approaches them, and as it grows close,
they experience thousands of strange blips of sound,
and it feels like they're being deafened by the mental noise.
They become attuned to it, and they notice a specific phrase being repeated:

> ...ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl ftagn...

Their vision fades, and they wake up on the shore, with their bodies rearranged.
They appear to have crawled out of the water in their sleep,
and put one hand back in the water.

They find themselves in a different cavern, and can now see a way out.
Even though it's nighttime, the water is still glowing.

They gather themselves, and notice a glint shining from the shallows.
When they pull it out of the water, they realize itâ€™s part of the *Tendril Medallion*.
Intricate symbols mark the back and the front,
however, there are no symbols in a depression along the top.
The face has notches indicating that something could be fit into it.

They exit the cavern, and find themselves along the shore.
