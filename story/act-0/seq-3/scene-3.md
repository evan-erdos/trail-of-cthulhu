The PCs resolve to carry out the ritual,
but remain ready to strike at the High Acolyte if the opportunity presents itself.

~~~
EXT. CENTERSTAGE, RUINS AMPITHEATER - NIGHT

A STUDENT wields the CEREMONIAL KNIFE, standing somewhat offstage.
The HIGH ACOLYTE presides over the bloody altar,
appearing pleased with what's about to happen.
He raises his hands, and the CROWD begins to chant twice as loudly.
The SACRIFICIAL STUDENT lies comatose on the altar,
eyes wide open, but completely unresponsive to his surroundings.

HIGH ACOLYTE
Approach the altar.
~~~


If the PCs are able to keep their heads,
then the High Acolyte will trust them, and let his guard down.[^guard]
If he doesn't believe they're genuine, he will keep his distance,
and the PCs will have no opportunity to strike him.


~~~
EXT. CENTERSTAGE, RUINS AMPITHEATER - NIGHT

The STUDENT approaches the bloody altar, knife in hand.
As the STUDENT brings the CEREMONIAL KNIFE down,
the SACRIFICIAL STUDENT begins to say their name.
His voice trails off after his heart is perforated by the knife.

The CROWD becomes instantly silent as the SACRIFICIAL STUDENT writhes.
For just a moment, the sound of waves breaking on rock can be heard in the distance.
The HIGH ACOLYTE moves towards the altar.

HIGH ACOLYTE
The Yellow King smiles upon you.
You have taken your first step towards becoming awakened.

The HIGH ACOLYTE pauses for a moment to disarm the STUDENT,
and continues to speak while he wipes the blood off of the CEREMONIAL KNIFE.

HIGH ACOLYTE
What do you wish to know?

STUDENTS
Who are you?

EFUA AMBALO
I am EFUA AMBALO, head priest of the Order of the Yellow Sign.

STUDENTS
You're the CHIEFTAIN's son?

EFUA AMBALO
No longer. I serve the Yellow King now.
My father was lost to the demons long ago.

STUDENTS
What can you tell us of the catacombs beneath the ruins?

EFUA AMBALO
Your awakening must continue before you learn such things.
The Yellow King instructs you to find the Dreaming One.
He told me of a sacred dream realm, larger than anyplace on earth,
which was watched over by a golden disc.
He told me of its wonder, how it filled the sky with wisps of gold.
You will find this dreamer, he can achieve your awakening.
~~~


The PCs set off to find him.[^dream]


[^guard]:
	**{ Reassurance }**:
	If the PCs are smooth enough, Efua will lower his guard.

[^dream]:
    This is a dream representation of the Tendril Medallion.
