Recalling what the **High Acolyte** told them,
the **[Players][]** return to the ruins at high-noon.
In proper daylight, they observe that there's a hole,
cut through the top of one of the pillars.
While the central pillar near the altar is in the shade,
a small, slot in the central pillar is illuminated by the light.

They place **The Dreamer**'s stone carving into the indentation,
and while it fits perfectly, nothing happens.[^0]

> Hey, you guys! Yeah, you, the player characters, hey!

> Yes?

> Remember how all the descriptions of that medallion described it as shining?

> Hey, yeah, you're right! And this puzzle is about optics, isn't it?

> Yeah, it is!

> Maybe we could try to emulate that sort of shining thing!

> Good idea!


Given the description the **High Acolyte** gave them of the *[medallion][]*,
the **[Players][]** realize that the *[medallion][]* would likely be reflective.

[#]: # (This puzzle might be too difficult or dumb)

They realize that if they put something reflective in the slot,
the light from the pillar is reflected.

With proper alignment, they emulate how the real thing would reflect light,
and the pillar begins to sink into the ground, revealing a passageway,
with a pretty steep set of stone stairs leading down.



[^0]: His handmade version of the *[Tendril Medallion][]* doesn't reflect light.
