As the PCs walk down the stairs of entrance, they hear rumbling.
The entrance begins to collapse, and they'd die if they tried to run back.
Stone begins to roll down the stairs, and if they aren't fast enough,[^0]
they'll be pretty severely hurt.

Now, they're a dozen feet underground, and possibly wounded.
While they're still in the dark, they're attacked by something.

Anyone who get close to it or are hit by it gain some insight into what it is.
If they spend the time to create a bit of light,
they begin to form an image of what their assailant looks like.
It's slimy, it has tentacles, and it doesn't appear to be touching the ground.

Once they defeat the creature, they assess their surroundings.
They're in a damp, underground grotto, and they can faintly hear running water.
Exploring the warrens, they find a ledge at the end of one passage.
They also find another cavern, with an underground river running through it.
