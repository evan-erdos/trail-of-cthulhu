Unless they attempted to lie to him, Ilya thanks them for reading the passage.

INT. OBSERVATORY ATRIUM - NIGHT

ILYA closes the GRIMOIRE.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Thank you. You have been very helpful.
I must be making preparation to depart now,
but I will send you for to be taken to the airport.

STUDENTS
What have you learned about the PROFESSOR's research?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Well, this is how you say, bad news.
Your professor appears to have learned nothing about our rockets,
so we must look elsewhere for where to find this thing.

STUDENTS
But, the artefact?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Your professor was... he was not well.
His writings and, all his notes, they were fantasy.
There are no magical masks, no evil powers here.
It would be best for you to put it out of your minds.

STUDENTS
But we witnessed many of the strange things he wrote about!
Something's going on here, it's not just our imagination.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
(sighing)
I would urge you to consider that the things you have experience were not real.
We do not know what your professor was doing,
but if you say you saw the same things he did, well...
I would have my own doubts.
My men will take you to Cairo as soon as they and you are ready.

When Ilya leaves, the PCs notice him take the Grimoire and all the notes with him.
