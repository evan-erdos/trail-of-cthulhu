Once inside, they can rife through desks and drawers,
read documents, and find some instructions.
They can go up to the Control Room, or down into the Atrium.
In the Control Room, they find classified documents,
which contain horrifying descriptions of secret military tests.

To read these, they need:

- **{ Physics / Astronomy }** to make sense of the technical diagrams
- **{ Evidence Collection }** to figure out which documents are important to steal

They learn that the Soviets have attempted to use live humans as guidance systems for ICBMs.

They also notice a number of documents which relate to the purpose of this Observatory.
They find one paper which describes, in depth,
how to sync the telescope with a quickly moving object in the night sky.

Believing the Observatory to be empty, they begin the process of syncing the telescope.

To attempt this, they need:

- **{ Physics / Astronomy }** to operate the telescope
- **{ Cryptography }** to figure out what the blinking means

If they have these skills, they are able to figure it out while they're here.
If they don't, they wont be able to question the Professor about what they're up to,
but they'll still be able to go back to the lab later and decode what they saw.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object[^space] through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

[^space]:
	**{ Astronomy }**:
	Sputnik was broadcasting small amounts of information up to a month after launch.


Just as they figure it out, both Professor Birchwell and Ilya Zolnerowich enter the Atrium.

While the Players are armed, they can't sustain a firefight.
While combat may ensue for a few turns,
they should be made aware that shooting isn't going to advance their cause.

When they surrender, Ilya takes their guns and the Medallion.
He then has a solider announce for him that he is going to test a new technology.

The troops push the Players onto the catwalk.
A group of students from the lab are brought in from the Entrance.
They all have a strange look about them.
Ilya lines them up, and we hear him speak a single word:

> Kill.

The instant he says this, hand to hand combat begins with the brainwashed students.

After combat, Ilya smirks, and raises his hand.
His troops raise their guns, ready to execute the students.
However, the Professor pleads to him for their lives.

Ilya looks away from the PCs for a moment, just long enough for them to try to escape.
Ilya looks at the Professor,
and it's as if his gaze alone crumpled the Professor to the floor.

[^escape]:
	To escape, they need:
	**{ Fleeing / Stealth }** for each Player
	**-1** to every Player's roll if **{ Fleeing < 3 }** for any Player
