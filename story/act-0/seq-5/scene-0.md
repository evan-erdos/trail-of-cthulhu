The PCs and Dolya have followed the Professor down a jungle road.
It opens up into a clearing, the centerpiece of which is a grand Observatory.

The PCs now must find a way past the guards, and into the building.
They have waited until dusk, and are along a dusty path which leads to the Observatory.
There isn't much activity around the Observatory.
However, there is a steady flow of vehicles entering and exiting the area.
Once inside, they must learn everything they can about the Professor, and the Soviets.

Coming from the southeast, there's a vehicle checkpoint, manned by 1 **Gate Guard**.
The checkpoint is run down and somewhat isolated from the rest of the area.
While the **Gate Guard** cannot be reasoned with,
he can be overpowered[^gate] and impersonated.[^who]
If they maintain the illusion long enough, they can hijack an incoming vehicle.[^fire]

[^gate]:
	**{ Scuffling / Athletics }**:
	They need to sneak up on him and incapacitate him somehow.
	**+1** bonus if they took the vines from the fence to tie him up with.

[^who]:
    **{ Disguise / Languages }**:
    Their impersonation of a gate guard doesn't need to be perfect,
    it just needs to last long enough to hijack a vehicle.

[^fire]:
	**{ Firearms / Weapons }**:
	This becomes harder if they fail to **Sense Trouble** as a vehicle is approaching,
	or if anyone in the group is particularly clumsy **{ Stealth / Athletics}**.

After they subdue him and set up shop, traffic will conveniently become less frequent,
allowing them the time to interrogate the **Gate Guard**.[^guard]

[^guard]:
	To get information out of him, they need **{ Languages }**.
	It also takes some effort to convince him to talk **{ Interrogation / Intimidation }**.
	This yields basic information about the Observatory, and its layout.
	However, if they ask about anything more, he claims to know nothing.
	To get more out of him, they need **{ Languages }** to understand him,
	**{ Intimidation / Psychoanalysis }** to get him to talk more,
	and **{ Assess Honesty / Psychoanalysis }** to verify he believes what he says.



~~~

If they gain entry, but aren't able to hijack a vehicle,
the PCs must sneak into the main Observatory on their own.

They make it past the guards, and enter the Observatory.[^in]

[^in]:
	3 **Guards** walk the perimeter at regular intervals.
	The **Guards** are humorless, and are immediately hostile to the PCs.
	On the opposite side of the Observatory, there's plenty of foliage.
	**{ Stealth / Athletics }**:
	They get across unseen, **+1** if they interrogated the **Gate Guard**.
	**{ Lockpicking / Architecture }**:
	to open the door or find another way in, **-1** if they run at the wrong time,
	or if they don't use the foliage as cover.
