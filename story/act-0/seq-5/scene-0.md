Having come up short, the PCs must now return to Ilya with their findings.
The PCs did find one item of interest, a Medallion,
but Borst and Dolya have split opinions about what to do with it.
Ilya appears to be in posession of the Professor's Grimoire now,
and is studying it intently.

INT. OBSERVATORY VIEWING PLATFORM - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS have returned from their mission,
and now must report their findings to ILYA,
who has promised them passage home upon completing this task.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Good to see friends. What have you found?

STUDENTS
The "Dreaming One" you sent us to look for was killed,
and we didn't find any crashed rockets.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Unfortunate, but it is not problem.
We have made progress here, decrypting what of the PROFESSOR's notes.
Come closer, I wonder if you are make sense of this.

The STUDENTS approach the desk and examine the strange book.
They're suprised to find that they are able to read the arcane scripts!
ILYA takes notice of this, and his eyes become wide.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
Ah, you can read it, yes?
Tell me, read me the section about using the artefact it describes.
We think it describes some sort of procedure, but we do not know.

They fully comprehend the passage. It reads:

> ...the Mask is a thing of great power, power greater than any living form can sustain.
> When handling the Mask, precautions must be taken.
> If it gets too close to its wearer, the power will become overwhelming.
> Once a being is gradually brought closer to the Mask, its power will attune.
> With a sufficiently long treatment, a person could even wear the Mask with no ill effects...


The PCs have a few options here, they can:

- read Ilya the passage, verbatim
- read Ilya most of the passage, but claim to not understand everything
- read the passage, but tell Ilya it means the opposite of what it says
- read him the passage, but omit subtle but critical details
