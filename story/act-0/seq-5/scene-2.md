As Ilya is leaving, a group of Soviet Soldiers arrive,
and say they are ready to leave for Cairo.

If the PCs protest, the Soldiers "insist", by brandishing their guns.
They are taken to a Soviet Army military transport,
and are loaded into the back along with other Soviet Troops.
The covering precludes the PCs from seeing where they're going.

The ride begins to get quite bumpy.
All of a sudden, someone near the front of the transport screams,
and they begin to run off the road.

They nearly roll over, and the covering is bent and twisted around them.

There is gunfire outside, and the PCs notice the transport's covering is being lashed at,
leaving gaping, tentacle-shaped tears in the canvas.

As they scramble out of the transport, they glance up.
They see dozens of tentacled figures, silhouetted by the night sky.

Their only sensible option here is to hide.[^hide]

[^hide]: **{ Fleeing }**: escape (mostly) unharmed

Once they escape the carnage,
they realize that they're closer to the Observatory than anything else.
They also know that Ilya has gone somewhere with the Grimoire.

With no means of transportation,
and no way to explain the transport filled with dead Soviet Soldiers,
the PCs, Dolya, and Borst have no other recourse but to sneak back into the Observatory.
