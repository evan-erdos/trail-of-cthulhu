The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab, again via note.[^note]

[^note]:
    A note under the door is not the usual channel for events in the lab.
    The Professor seems to be hand selecting the people who he intends to speak to.

It reads:

![note-0]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/birchwell-note-1.png)


Upon their arrival, they find Professor Birchwell has begun well ahead of schedule.
They also notice a girl that they've never seen before,
watching from the back of the lab.[^girl]

[^girl]:
    Enter Dolya Petrovna, a Soviet Journalist.

INT. MAIN LABORATORY - MORNING

The PROFESSOR sits at the center of the main lab.
His cheerful mood seems ill-befitting of the recent events,
and the "doctor jokes" he's telling to a GROUP OF STUDENTS border on being inappropriate.

PROFESSOR
The psyche ward is... quite an experience, especially your first shift.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
What do you mean, PROFESSOR?

PROFESSOR
Well, I had this one patient, Harold.
He'd wander out his room from time to time, and ask me things.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
Like what, professor?

PROFESSOR
Well, he'd say, "What do I do, Doctor? It hurts when I do *this*!"

The professor violently pantomimes raising his hand, and the students giggle.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
What did you do then, PROFESSOR?

PROFESSOR
Well, I said to him rather plainly, "Ok, Harold. Don't do that."
Then he raises his hand again, and says, "Thanks doc!"

The professor makes the gesture a second time,
and a few of the students laugh, possibly out of pity.

As the laughter is dying down, Borst enters the hall.
He runs up to the Professor, and whispers something to him.[^hint]
A scared look runs across the Professor's face.
He thanks Borst, and continues to prepare.

[^hint]:
    He tells him that Ilya Zolnerowich is unhappy with him about his progress,
    and that Ilya has shown up, unannounced, to check on him.

INT. MAIN LABORATORY - MORNING

Right before 11:00AM, a GROUP of men enter the room,
where PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL is preparing to give a presentation.
Their uniforms bear the insignia of the Soviet Union.
The GIRL in the back takes notice, and pulls out a notepad.
The GROUP sits down in the back of the room.
Ever punctual, he begins his lecture, but he's stammering.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Ah, l-l-let's... g-g-get started, h-here! Ok!
I... I'd, like to introduce, uh, our honored, uh, guests, or...
Everyone? I'd like to welcome ILYA ZOLNEROWICH, and his team.

ILYA smiles warmly, and turns around in his seat to face the rest of the lab.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
They're doing some unrelated research in the area.
We try to stay out of their way, but sometimes we run into eachother.
Try not to step on their toes if we do see them, as I'm sure they will do for us!
Now, on to our presen...

The PROFESSOR trails off as ILYA stands, and calmly walks to the front.
The two speak quietly for a moment, and then ILYA begins to leave the room.
The PROFESSOR stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

PROFESSOR
Let's-ss-s... I'm going to, uh, a tangent... talk about ethics.
What defines... w-w-who's to say... what's right and what's wrong?
Is th-there any universal... real universal thing, that, that,
that marks a particular action to be morally good, o-o-or bad?

He trails off, and looks at his watch multiple times.

PROFESSOR
I w-want... each of you, hm, do something you know to be ethically wrong.
Be... to, at, rather, the next lecture with... half a page about...
Class is--
~~~


The sound of glass shattering emanates from somewhere on the other side of the lab,
and a small fire breaks out below a nearby fume hood.
Professor Birchwell watches the fire spread for a moment, giggling.[^fire]
At this time, the PCs notice the girl writing feverishly in her book.
Some students put it out, and the class disperses.

[^fire]:
    Professor Birchwell is beginning to lose his grip on reality.
    He doesn't seem to realize how insensitive his jokes are,
    especially in light of the recent events with Oscar.
