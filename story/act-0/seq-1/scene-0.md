The next day, the **[Players][]** are summoned to the main lab, again via note.[^0]

It reads:

>> <tt>OCTOBER 3, 1957</tt>
>>
>> <tt>PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL IS GIVING A LECTURE:</tt>
>>
>> <tt>BEST PRACTICES WHEN DEALING WITH NATIVE PEOPLES</tt>
>>
>> <tt>MAIN LAB, 1100 HOURS, ATTENDANCE MANDATORY</tt>

Upon their arrival, they find that **[Professor Birchwell][]** has begun well ahead of schedule.
The players notice a girl they've never seen before, watching him from the back of the lab.[^1]
The professor's in a cheerful mood, and is telling "doctor jokes" to a group of students.

> The psyche ward is... quite an experience, especially your first shift.

> What do you mean, professor?

> Well, I had this one patient, Harold.
> He'd wander out his room from time to time, and ask me things.

> Like what, professor?

> Well, he'd say, "What do I do, Doctor? It hurts when I do *this*!"

The professor violently pantomimes raising his hand, and the students giggle.

> What did you do then, professor?

> Well, I said to him rather plainly, "Ok, Harold. Don't do that."
> Then he raises his hand again, and says, "Thanks doc!"

The professor makes the gesture a second time, and the room breaks out in laughter.
Right before 11:00AM, the girl in the corner walks up to the professor,
says something to him, and quickly leaves the room.[^2]

Ever punctual, the professor begins his lecture, but he's stammering.
If the **[Players][]** attempt to leave the room at this point,
the professor will single them out, and tell them to stay.

**[Professor Birchwell][]** stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch,
and begins to talk about ethics, and the difference between right and wrong.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.
He concludes with a very strange assignment:

> I want... each of you to do something you know to be ethically wrong.
> Come to the next lecture with half a page about the experience.
>
> Or... don't. It's all... pointless... class is...

Before he says "dismissed", the **[Players][]** hear glass shattering,
somewhere on the other side of the lab. A small fire breaks out below a fume hood.
**[Professor Birchwell][]** watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.[^3]
Some students put it out, and the students disperse.


[^0]: A note under the door is not the usual channel for events in the lab.
[^1]: Enter **[Dolya Petrovna][]**, a Soviet Journalist.
[^2]: She tells him that **[Ilya Zolnerowich][]** is unhappy with him about his progress.
[^3]: **[Professor Birchwell][]** is beginning to lose his grip on reality.
