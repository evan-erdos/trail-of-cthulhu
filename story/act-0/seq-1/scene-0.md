The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab, again via note.[^0]

It reads:

Upon their arrival, they find that Professor Birchwell has begun well ahead of schedule.
They also notice a girl that they've never seen before, watching from the back of the lab.[^1]

INT. MAIN LABORATORY - MORNING

The PROFESSOR is at the center of the main lab,
and appears to be in a cheerful mood. a
He's telling telling "doctor jokes" to a GROUP OF STUDENTS.

PROFESSOR
The psyche ward is... quite an experience, especially your first shift.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
What do you mean, PROFESSOR?

PROFESSOR
Well, I had this one patient, Harold.
He'd wander out his room from time to time, and ask me things.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
Like what, professor?

PROFESSOR
Well, he'd say, "What do I do, Doctor? It hurts when I do *this*!"

The professor violently pantomimes raising his hand, and the students giggle.

GROUP OF STUDENTS
What did you do then, PROFESSOR?

PROFESSOR
Well, I said to him rather plainly, "Ok, Harold. Don't do that."
Then he raises his hand again, and says, "Thanks doc!"

The professor makes the gesture a second time, and the room breaks out in laughter.

Right before 11:00AM, Borst enters the hall.
The girl sees him, and walks up to the Professor.
The three have a short conversation, and then Borst and the girl quickly leave the room.[^2]

Ever punctual, the Professor begins his lecture, but he's stammering.

INT. MAIN LABORATORY - MORNING

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

PROFESSOR
Let's-ss-s... I'm going to, uh, a tangent... talk about ethics.
What defines... w-w-who's to say... what's right and what's wrong?
Is th-there any universal... real universal thing, that, that,
that marks a particular action to be morally good, o-o-or bad?

He trails off, and looks at his watch multiple times.

PROFESSOR
I w-want... each of you, hm, do something you know to be ethically wrong.
Be... to, at, rather, the next lecture with... half a page about...
Class is--

The sound of glass shattering emanates from somewhere on the other side of the lab,
and a small fire breaks out below a nearby fume hood.
Professor Birchwell watches the fire spread for a moment, giggling.[^3]
Some students put it out, and the class disperses.

[^0]: A note under the door is not the usual channel for events in the lab.
[^1]: Enter Dolya Petrovna, a Soviet Journalist.
[^2]: She tells him that Ilya Zolnerowich is unhappy with him about his progress.
[^3]: Professor Birchwell is beginning to lose his grip on reality.
[^4]: He knows what's going on, but won't tell the PCs.
