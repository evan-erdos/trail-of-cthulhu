As they conclude with Chieftain Ambalo, they notice the Professor slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He walks directly into the woods, and comes to a stop along a small bridge.

The PCs hide in the brush, slightly downstream.
The sound of the water prevents Professor Birchwell from hearing them.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to a group of Soviet Troops.
They also recognize Ilya, who is standing at the other end of the bridge.[^safe]

[^safe]:
    Ilya knows that he's taking a risk with the Professor.
    He still hasn't perfected the mask's mind control ability,
    and what's more, the Professor is armed.

All of a sudden, the Professor pulls out a gun.
He shoots one of the Soviet Officers, and then takes aim at Ilya.
At a distance, Ilya appears to be thourougly scandalized.
His precise reaction, however, is harder to gauge.
His face seems to shimmer as he looks around, albeit subtly.[^mask]

[^mask]:
    Ilya is wearing the Mask of Hastur,
    allowing him to induce command hallucinations on a whim.
    This is what he's using on the Professor,
    but he doesn't have it down to a science quite yet.


A twig breaks, and Ilya looks directly at the PCs.
As this happens, the Professor looks unsteady on his feet.
Ilya looks back at the Professor, who promptly drops his gun,
and the Professor begins walking back towards the village at a leisurely pace.

EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH and an attach√© of SOLIDERS approach the STUDENTS.

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
You there! Do not move, we do not hurt you!
Are you by chance student, of the PROFESSOR?

STUDENTS
Yes, we're with him. Is that man OK?
What's going on? Should we get help?

ILYA ZOLNEROWICH
It is no danger, I promise. Nobody is hurt.
Are you feel OK? Do you feel safe here?
~~~


The PCs suddenly begin to have a strange sensation.[^feel]
The sun gets brighter, and its warmth feels like it's embracing them.
The bridge's wooden frame gleams in the sunlight,
and the trickling of the water seems almost friendly.

[^feel]:
    When Ilya looks at the PCs, the Mask of Hastur begins to effect them.
    It exerts a powerful force over their perceptions,
    and induces these feelings of wellbeing and happiness.

When they look again, the PCs find the bridge to be spotless,
devoid of any bullet shells or blood.[^bridge]
They delight in the way the grass wavers about in the warm sun,
and they get the feeling that everything is going to be OK.

[^bridge]:
    The bridge appears clean to them by Ilya's design.
    They need to believe that the Professor didn't murder anyone.

They find that they've walked back to the village,
with only the faintest inkling that Ilya asked them some questions.
While they're unable to remember any details,
they do remember that Ilya's chief concern was their safety and wellbeing,
and that if they ever ran into trouble with the Professor,
they could always trust Ilya to keep them safe, or get them home.

Having concluded their business in the area,
the PCs feel compelled to get back to the Laboratory.
