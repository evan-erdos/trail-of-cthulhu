If the PCs confront Professor Birchwell about what he did,
he's going to do everything he can to not explain it.[^0]

> We didn't find any evidence of trypanosomiasis in the lab, professor, what are you doing?

Professor Birchwell erupts with anger towards the PCs,
almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets, and his research.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go, with a firm warning:

> Do not pursue this, you know nothing of what's at stake.


The PCs must now decide whether to investigate the other tribe,
or the Soviet troops they saw the professor with.

[^0]: He's also going to try to determine if it was the PCs he saw in the woods.
