The PCs return to their Quarters.
They may try to look for the Professor or reanalyze their research,
but the Professor isn't in the lab or in his office, so they eventually retire to bed.

Late at night, they awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their rooms.[^fire]
On their way out, they observe some of their peers doing very strange things.

INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS travel through a section of the lab which has caved in.
A CRYING STUDENT is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.

STUDENTS
(to the CRYING STUDENT)
There's a door, right next to you!

CRYING STUDENT
(yelling)
No! You can't! Don't leave!
I have to get through! No! NO!
The door! The door!
If I don't get through, they'll kill me!
~~~

If they do anything but leave him alone after this, he attacks.

The building seems stable enough, so the PCs may have a look around.[^look]
As they pass Professor Birchwell's office, they grab whatever they can.

INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS are trying to escape from their burning laboratory.
An INCENSED STUDENT is pacing madly, gesticulating and muttering to himself.
The STUDENTS won't be able to get out without him noticing them.

STUDENTS
Are you OK?

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... the men, gods, men, gods, awake, wake, wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to escape, come with us, we'll get you help!

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... awakened, wake, woke...

The STUDENTS attempt to pass him, presuming he's unresponsive.

INCENSED STUDENT
No, no, LEAVE, NO, do... You! You, staying?
Awakened, you are awakened ones! You are!

STUDENTS
What do you mean by awakened?

INCENSED STUDENT
That you do not... you know, you understand, you are the awakened!
You cannot, cannot... cannot let leave, awakened ones, awake... wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to leave, the building is burning.

INCENSED STUDENT
Awakened ones are not, afraid of burning, afraid of fire, afraid of gods,
you are... are... awakened, woken...

[^fire]:
    Professor Birchwell started the fire to destroy his research.
    He was working with the Soviets, but now he wants to find the rocket himself.
    If they found his research, they wouldn't need him anymore, and might kill him.
    While burning the lab was somewhat sensible, the Professor is losing his grip.

[^look]:
    Some parts of the lab aren't burned, they've been smashed.
    The Professor used a minor spell from his Grimoire to posess them,
    and he instructed them to destroy the lab, and his research.
