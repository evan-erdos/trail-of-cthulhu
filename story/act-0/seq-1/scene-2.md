The caravan gathers itself, and they have an uneventful journey back to the Lab.
If the PCs confront Professor Birchwell about what he did,
he's going to do everything he can to not explain it.[^0]

INT. LABORATORY, AFTERNOON

The caravan returns to the lab,
and the STUDENTS begin to question PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL.

STUDENTS
We didn't find any evidence of trypanosomiasis in the lab, what are you doing?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Th-that's nothing of your... not your concern!
You, wh-wh-what... who are you to question my medical opinion?!
You pull something like that, you... you might kill us, or...

STUDENTS
It was objectively false, it can't be T.B.r, we're too far Nor--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Y-You aren't, how am I supposed t-to trust you with m-my research,
if I can't trust you to not, not... trust that I have...

STUDENTS

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
--You're the spies, aren't you? You've been spying on my research!

STUDENTS
What on earth are you talking about?
Wait, you mean to tell us... you're saying there's spies? Here?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
You! You're, ah, you're right, about... They don't have T.B.r, I made it up.
There's something very strange going on there, but...
I can't... rather, I don't know what, but, but, I warn you!
Do not pursue this, you know nothing of what's at stake!
