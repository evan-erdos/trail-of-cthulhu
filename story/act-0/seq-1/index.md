The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab, again via note.
Upon their arrival, they find that Professor Birchwell has begun well ahead of schedule.
The players notice a girl they've never seen before, watching him from the back of the lab.
The professor's in a cheerful mood, and is telling "doctor jokes" to a group of students.

Right before 11:00AM, the girl in the corner walks up to the professor,
says something to him, and quickly leaves the room.

Ever punctual, the professor begins his lecture, but he's stammering.
He stutters through a few slides, then skips a bunch,
and begins to talk about ethics, and the difference between right and wrong.
He's sweating, and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

The PCs hear glass shattering, somewhere on the other side of the lab.
A small fire breaks out below a fume hood.
Professor Birchwell watches the fire spread for a moment, and giggles.
Some students put it out, and the audience begins to disperse.

They return to the village to present the chief with their findings.
Professor Birchwell tells the Chieftain that the village has *trypanosomiasis*
(African Sleeping Sickness), however,
none of the samples the PCs analyzed corroborate this.
The Chieftain characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.
As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He stops at a bridge in the woods, and the PCs observe him at a distance.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone on the other side of the bridge.
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the PCs, but says nothing to the man.
Professor Birchwell begins to leave, and the PCs run through the woods to arrive before him.

The PCs confront Professor Birchwell about what he did,
and he erupts with anger, almost incoherently babbling about trust and secrets.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go.

The PCs awake to the sound of sirens, and flee their rooms.
It smells like smoke, and sections of the Laboratory are crumbling.
They observe some of their peers doing very strange things.
After they escape the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
It's slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.
