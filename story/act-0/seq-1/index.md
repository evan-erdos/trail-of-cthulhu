The next day, the PCs are summoned to the main lab, again via note.

The Professor begins to give his talk, but he's sweating,
and fumbling with the controls of the slide projector.

The PCs hear glass shattering, somewhere on the other side of the lab.
A small fire breaks out, and Professor Birchwell watches it for a moment, giggling.
Some students put it out, and the audience begins to disperse.

They return to the village to present the chief with their findings.
Professor Birchwell tells the Chieftain that the village has *trypanosomiasis*
(African Sleeping Sickness), however, none of the samples the PCs analyzed corroborate this.

As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
He stops at a bridge in the woods, and the PCs observe him at a distance.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone on the other side of the bridge.

Later, the PCs confront Professor Birchwell about what he did, and he erupts with anger,
incoherently babbling about trust and secrets.
He accuses them of spying on him, and trying to kill him.
After a thorough accosting, he lets them go.

The PCs awake to the sound of sirens, and flee their rooms.
It smells like smoke, and sections of the Laboratory are crumbling.
They observe some of their peers doing very strange things.

After they escape the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
It's slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.
