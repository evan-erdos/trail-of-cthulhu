INT. CHIEFTAIN'S HUT, MORNING

The STUDENTS and PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL return to the CHIEFTAIN's hut.
He's still in bed, and appears to be even more insane.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Greetings, Chieftain.

CHIEFTAIN
Ah, the good doctor has returned!
He will rid us of these spirits.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Not spirits, but rather African trypanosomiasis,
the dreaded sleeping sickness.
As it has been roughly a month,
we have brough a supply of melarsoprol, and...

STUDENTS
Uh, professor, aren't we supposed to use a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine?
I thought melarsoprol was only for cases of T.b.r. because of the side effect profile.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
What you fail to understand is that melarsoprol is effective against both paricites,
and since we have no way of telling if this is a case of T.b.g. or T.b.r.,
the only logical course of action is to use the more effective treatment, now may I--

STUDENTS
--Aren't cases of T.b.g. about 50 times more frequent?
Also, I don't think tsetse flies live this far north.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
ENOUGH. Need I remind you how long I've worked in this area?
You will hold your tongue until we return to the lab.

The Chieftain characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.
As they conclude with the Chieftain, they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He walks directly into the woods, and comes to a stop in the middle of a small bridge over a tiny creek.
The PCs hide in the brush, slightly downstream.
The sound of the water prevents Professor Birchwell from hearing them approach.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to someone they can't see, on the other side of the bridge.[^4]
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the PCs, but says nothing to the man.
Professor Birchwell departs towards the village.
The PCs run through the woods to arrive before him, seeking to avoid suspicion.
