They return to the village to present Chieftain Ambalo with their findings.
The PCs notice that they are the only ones present who were also on the initial expedition.
Professor Birchwell begins the conversation with the Chieftain.

INT. CHIEFTAIN'S HUT - MORNING

The STUDENTS and PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL return to the CHIEFTAIN's hut.
He's still in bed, and appears to be even more insane.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Greetings, CHIEFTAIN.

CHIEFTAIN AMBALO
Ah, the good doctor has returned!
He will rid us of these spirits.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Not spirits, but rather African trypanosomiasis,
the dreaded sleeping sickness.
As it has been roughly a month,
we have brough a supply of melarsoprol, and...

If they notice the discrepancy, the PCs can ask the Professor about it.[^med]

[^med]:
    **{ Medicine }**:
    Doctors and cunning PCs will recognize this diagnosis to be objectively false.
    African Sleeping Sickness is almost unheard of in the area.

INT. CHIEFTAIN'S HUT - MORNING

STUDENTS
Uh, professor, aren't we supposed to use a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine?
I thought melarsoprol was only for cases of T.b.r. because of the side effect profile.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
What you fail to understand is that melarsoprol is effective against both paricites,
and since we have no way of telling if this is a case of T.b.g. or T.b.r.,
the only logical course of action is to use the more effective treatment, now may I--

STUDENTS
--Aren't cases of T.b.g. about 50 times more frequent?
Also, I don't think tsetse flies live this far north.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
ENOUGH. Need I remind you how long I've worked in this area?
You will hold your tongue until we return to the lab.

The Chieftain characteristically suggests that they kill the whole neighboring tribe.

He pleads to the PCs to find the missing villagers, and his son,
claiming that they are in the lair of the so-called "Demon Worshippers".[^hastur]

[^hastur]:
    The "Demon" is Hastur, and his "worshippers" are members of the other tribe.

Even if the PCs have no interest in saving the villagers,
they decide that going to investigate the other tribe could prove to be helpful,
as it might provide them with new insights into the nature of the Ambalo Tribe's plight.

As they conclude with Chieftain Ambalo,
they notice Professor Birchwell slip away again.
They trail him as he weaves his way through the village, to the edge of town.
He walks directly into the woods, and comes to a stop on a small bridge.

The PCs hide in the brush, slightly downstream.
The sound of the water prevents Professor Birchwell from hearing them approach.
They realize he's speaking in Russian to a group of Soviet Troops.
A twig breaks, and the professor looks directly at the PCs, but says nothing to the man.
Professor Birchwell departs towards the village.
The PCs run through the woods to arrive before him, to avoid suspicion.
