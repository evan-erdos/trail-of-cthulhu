They continue reading through the material they found.
While most of the notes are too abstruse to understand, one thing becomes clear:
The Professor wasn't interested in these costal tribes to cure them.
He was looking for some sort of strange artefact,
and his recent entries indicate that he found it.

The PCs observe a lone figure in the distance.
They recognize the figure to be Professor Birchwell as he walks to the North Grounds.
They hear the sound of a jeep being started, and wheels turning in the dirt.

EXT. SMOULDERING LAB - DAWN

The STUDENTS are preparing to give chase to the PROFESSOR,
when they hear someone scream from somewhere in the dark, behind them.

DOLYA PETROVNA
Wait! Wait! Stop!

STUDENTS
A survivor!

DOLYA PETROVNA
Wait! Take me with you!

STUDENTS
You're the girl from the lab, with the notebook!

DOLYA PETROVNA
DOLYA, it's a pleasure, truly.
Where are you going in such a hurry?
What is going on here?

The PCs explain to Dolya their best theory about what's going on.
She says she's a Soviet reporter,
and that she might be able to help them find the Professor.

(At this point, Dolya joins the party)
