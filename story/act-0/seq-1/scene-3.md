**[Players][]** don't get to the assignment, because the lab catches fire.[^0]
They awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their rooms.
On their way out, they observe some of their peers doing very strange things.[^1]

The **[Players][]** travel through a section of the building which has caved in.
A **Crying Student** is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.
If the **[Players][]** mention there's a window he can escape through, he says:

> No! You can't! Don't leave! I have to get through! No! NO!
> The door! The door! If I don't get through, they'll kill me!

If they continue to try to reason with him, he attacks.

The building doesn't appear to be coming down anytime soon,
so the **[Players][]** look through the lab,[^2] but don't find anything.

As they pass **[Professor Birchwell][]**'s office, they grab whatever they can.[^3]
An **Incensed Student** bars the door as they try to leave, they can:

- kill the **Incensed Student** to escape
- leave the **Incensed Student** to his fate
- actively attempt to save the **Incensed Student**


[^0]: **[Professor Birchwell][]** started the fire to destroy his research.
[^1]: The students have been possessed, and have been instructed to destroy.
[^2]: Some parts of the lab aren't burned, they've been smashed.
[^3]: This is, in fact, *[Birchwell's Grimoire][grimoire]*, a powerful spell-tome.
