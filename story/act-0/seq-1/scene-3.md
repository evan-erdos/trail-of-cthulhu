PCs don't get to the assignment, because the lab catches fire.[^0]
They awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their rooms.
On their way out, they observe some of their peers doing very strange things.[^1]

~~~
INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS travel through a section of the lab which has caved in.
A CRYING STUDENT is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.

STUDENTS
(to the CRYING STUDENT)
There's a door, right next to you!

CRYING STUDENT
(yelling)
No! You can't! Don't leave!
I have to get through! No! NO!
The door! The door!
If I don't get through, they'll kill me!
~~~

If they do anything but leave him alone after this, he attacks.

The building doesn't appear to be coming down anytime soon,
so the PCs look through the lab,[^2] but don't find anything.

As they pass Professor Birchwell's office, they grab whatever they can.[^3]

~~~
INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS are trying to escape from their burning laboratory.
An INCENSED STUDENT is pacing madly, gesticulating and muttering to himself.
The STUDENTS won't be able to get out without him noticing them.

STUDENTS
Are you OK?

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... the men, gods, men, gods, awake, wake, wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to escape, come with us, we'll get you help!

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... awakened, wake, woke...

The STUDENTS attempt to pass him, presuming he's unresponsive.

INCENSED STUDENT
No, no, LEAVE, NO, do... You! You, staying?
Awakened, you are awakened ones! You are!

STUDENTS
What do you mean by awakened?

INCENSED STUDENT
That you do not... you know, you understand, you are the awakened!
You cannot, cannot... cannot let leave, awakened ones, awake... wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to leave, the building is burning.

INCENSED STUDENT
Awakened ones are not, afraid of burning, afraid of fire, afraid of gods,
you are... are... awakened, woken...

[^1]: The students have been possessed, and have been instructed to destroy.
[^2]: Some parts of the lab aren't burned, they've been smashed.
