Having escaped the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
They find strange diagrams and symbols,
unrelated to any practice of medicine they've ever seen.[^note]
Most of what they find is too abstruse to understand,
however one thing becomes clear:
The Professor wasn't interested in these costal tribes to cure them:
he was looking for something, and he seems to have found it.

[^note]:
    Further examination of his notebook reveals a Tendril-Like Glyph.
    The notes are slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.

EXT. SMOULDERING LAB - DAWN

A group of STUDENTS have escaped the burning laboratory,
and are standing a safe distance away from it's crumbling walls.
As they begin to look through the few papers they scrounged from the PROFESSOR's office,
they notice a figure walking towards them in the distance.
As he comes closer, they recognize that it's PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL.
The STUDENTS hastily conceal the notes they took from his office as he approaches.
He looks alarmed, and he's carrying what looks to be a packed suitcase.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Thank, thank god you're all, you've all made it out...

The PROFESSOR's voice is cold and toneless,
as if it were drained of all emotion.

STUDENTS
What's going on?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
A fire must have started when someone was working late,
or, early... early morning...

STUDENTS
You seem remarkably well prepared, professor.
Do you always pack your bags and leave the building at 4AM?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
I was lucky.
I couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd... I've been out walking.

STUDENTS
With a full suitcase?

The PROFESSOR doesn't reply in any way.

STUDENTS
Why did you tell that chieftian his village had trypanosomiasis?
We didn't find any evidence of that in the lab.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Who are you to question my medical opinion?
You pull something like that, you... you might kill us, or...

STUDENTS
It was flat out wrong, it can't be T.B.r, we're too far Nor--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
How am I supposed to trust you with m-my research,
if I can't trust you to not, not... trust that I have...

STUDENTS
That you have to lie to those helpless villagers abou--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
--You're the spies, aren't you?
You've been spying on my research.

STUDENTS
What on earth are you talking about?
Wait, you mean to tell us... you're saying there's spies? Here?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
You! You're, ah, you're right, about...
They don't have T.B.r, I made it up.
There's something very strange going on there, but...
I can't... rather, I don't know what, but... but...

The PROFESSOR pauses, having noticed something in the STUDENTS' possession.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Where did you get that pen?

The PROFESSOR's eyes grow very wide.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Did you take anything with you... out of the building?

STUDENTS
No, professor, just--

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
You did, didn't you? That pen was in my office.
What else did you take?

STUDENTS
No, we--

The PROFESSOR draws his gun, and cocks it.

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Open that bag.

The STUDENTS have no choice but to do as he asks.
The PROFESSOR takes almost everything they found,
minus a few illegible papers and the page with the glyph on it.

STUDENTS
You started this fire, didn't you?

PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL
Strange things are happening here. Things I cannot explain.
The Soviets are not what they seem, and I had to make...
make sure they didn't find anything here.
You need to leave. Go home.
If you get involved with this,
you will be in more danger than you can imagine.
Find a way home, get out of here,
and never speak of this to anyone.

The PROFESSOR lowers his weapon, and heads northeast, to the Staging Grounds.
The STUDENTS hear the sound of a jeep being started, and wheels turning in the dirt.
The PROFESSOR drives down the north road, and is gone.

Not wanting to lose the Professor, the PCs take another jeep, and follow him.
