The PCs return to their Quarters.
They may try to look for the Professor or reanalyze their research,
but the Professor isn't in the lab or in his office, so they eventually retire to bed.

Late at night, they awake to find Cindy screaming and clawing at the door.
Their ears are ringing, and while it *sounds* like a fire alarm, something's off.[^fire]

[^fire]:
    Professor Birchwell started the fire to destroy his research.
    He was working with the Soviets, but now he wants to find the rocket himself.
    If they found his research, they wouldn't need him anymore, and might kill him.
    While burning the lab was somewhat sensible, the Professor is losing his grip.

INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS are frantically gathering their things,
while CINDY claws at the door so vigorously that her fingers are bleeding.

STUDENTS
(to CINDY)
There's a door, right next to you!

CINDY
(yelling)
No! You can't! Don't leave!
I have to get through! No! NO!
The door! The door! The ringing! AHH!
If I don't get through, they'll kill me!
~~~

If they do anything but leave her alone after this, she attacks.

As they travel through a section of the lab which has caved in,
they come across an Incensed Student, tearing through some papers.[^look]


[^look]:
    Some parts of the lab aren't burned, they've been smashed.
    The Professor used a minor spell from his Grimoire to posess them,
    and he instructed them to destroy the lab, and his research.

INT. BURNING LABORATORY - MORNING

A group of STUDENTS are trying to escape from their burning laboratory.
An INCENSED STUDENT is pacing madly, gesticulating and muttering to himself.
He seems to be quite interested in the contents of the bookshelf,
which is barring the most obvious egress from the burning building.
The STUDENTS won't be able to get out without him noticing them.

STUDENTS
Are you OK?

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... the men, gods, men, gods, awake, wake, wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to escape, come with us, we'll get you help!

INCENSED STUDENT
(to himself)
... awakened, wake, woke...

The INCENSED STUDENT swings violently at the papers on the shelf,
tearing some of them, albeit inefficiently.
The STUDENTS attempt to pass him, presuming him to be focused solely on the papers.

INCENSED STUDENT
No, no, LEAVE, NO, do... You! You, staying?
Ringing, awakened, you are awakened ones! You are!

STUDENTS
What do you mean by awakened?

INCENSED STUDENT
That you do not... you know, you understand, you are the awakened!
You cannot, cannot... cannot ring, leave, awakened ones, awake... wake...

STUDENTS
We'd like to leave, the building is burning.

INCENSED STUDENT
Awakened ones are not, afraid of burning, afraid of fire, afraid of gods,
you are... are... awakened, woken...
~~~

Time being of the essence, the PCs may decide to incapacitate him to escape.
Ears still ringing, the PCs push their way out of the building,
having grabbed whatever they saw fit to take from the bookshelf.

When they look back at the lab, it's like it never existed:
the outline of their dormitories isn't where it should be,
and the main lab has been reduced to rubble.

The strange part is that they're alone.
It's as if they're the only ones who even tried to get out.
Just as they get to safety and begin assessing their situation,
the ringing in their ears stops.

Having escaped the lab, the PCs pore over the notes they found.
They find strange diagrams and symbols,
unrelated to any practice of medicine they've ever seen.[^note]

[^note]:
    Further examination of his notebook reveals a Tendril-Like Glyph.
    The notes are slightly helpful, but now they need to learn more.
