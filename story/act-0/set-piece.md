Act I Set Piece : The Observatory
=================================

## Exposition ##

_October 20th, 1957_

You have learned of a strange Jungle Observatory,
being operated by Soviet spies in Northern Africa.
Sputnik has been in low Earth orbit for a few weeks now,
and you have reason to believe that not everything is as it seems.

Having tracked Dolya and the Soviets to a Secret Observatory,
the Players now must find a way past the guards, and into the building.
They have waited until dusk, and are along a Dusty Path, which leads to the Observatory.
There isn't much activity around the Observatory, however,
there is a steady flow of vehicles entering and exiting the area.
Once inside, they must learn everything they can about the Soviet's operations.

---

Coming from the southeast, there's a vehicle checkpoint, manned by 1 **Gate Guard**.
The checkpoint is run down and somewhat isolated from the rest of the area.
While the **Gate Guard** cannot be reasoned with, he can be overpowered and impersonated.

To achieve this, the Players need:

- (**Scuffling 3** / **Athletics 5**) to overpower the **Gate Guard**
    - **+1** to each roll if:
        - they took the vines from the fence to tie him up with
- (**Disguise 2** & **Languages 2**) to impersonate the **Gate Guard**
- (**Firearms 2** / **Weapons 3**) to hijack an incoming vehicle
- **-1** to each roll if:
    - they fail a **Sense Trouble > 2** roll as a vehicle is approaching
    - **Stealth < 2** for any Player involved in the above actions

After they subdue him and set up shop, traffic will conveniently become less frequent,
allowing them the time to interrogate the **Gate Guard**.

To get information out of him, they need:

- (**Languages 1**) to understand him
- (**Interrogation 2** / **Intimidation 2**) to convince him to talk

This yields basic information about the Observatory, and its layout.

> It is Observatory, with refractor telescope in the middle.
> There are metal path around inside edge,
> and stairs from the paths to entrance, and up to Control Room.

> In Control Room, there are lot of office... and papers, things.
> I not... I lack clearance to go in Control Room, I am apologize.

They can ask about guard movements:

> Three guards patrol outside base, 5 minute interval.
> Inside? no guards. The scientist, he does not allow these things.

However, if they ask about anything more, he claims to know nothing:

> Such things, above my pay grade, as you say.

To get more out of him, they need:

- (**Languages 1**) to understand him
- (**Intimidation 3** / **Psychoanalysis 4**) to get him to talk more
- (**Assess Honesty 3** / **Psychoanalysis 4**) to verify he believes what he says


They can ask him about the "scientist":

> Scientist? He is British. I have not spoken to him personal.

They can ask him about the chain of command:

> I report to Ilya Zolnerowich. I do not know of where he is.

Eventually, he will refuse to betray his people any further:

> Enough, American dogs. You kill me now, for Mother Russia!

---

If they gain entry, but aren't able to hijack a vehicle,
the Players must sneak into the main Observatory on their own.

3 **Guards** walk the perimeter at regular intervals.
The **Guards** are humorless, and are immediately hostile to the Players.
On the opposite side of the Observatory, there's plenty of foliage.

To get inside, they need:

- (**Stealth 2** / **Athletics 4**) to get across unseen
    - **+1** to each roll if:
        - they interrogated the **Gate Guard**
- (**Lockpicking 3** / **Architecture 2**) to open the door / find another way in
- **-1** to each roll if:
    - they run at the wrong time
    - they don't use the foliage as cover

---

Once inside, they can begin to look through papers and drawers for clues.
They can go up to the Control Room, or down into the Atrium.
In the Control Room, they find classified documents,
which contain horrifying descriptions of secret military tests.

To read these, they need:

- (**Physics 3** / **Astronomy 3**) to make sense of the technical diagrams
- (**Evidence Collection 2**) to figure out which documents are important to steal

They learn that the Soviets have attempted to use live humans as guidance systems for ICBMs.

They also notice a number of documents which relate to the purpose of this Observatory.
They find one paper which describes, in depth,
how to sync the telescope with a quickly moving object in the night sky.

Believing the Observatory to be empty, they begin the process of syncing the telescope.

To attempt this, they need:

- (**Physics 3** / **Astronomy 3**) to operate the telescope
- (**Cryptography 2**) to figure out what the blinking means

If they have these skills, they are able to figure it out while they're here.
If they don't, they wont be able to question the Professor about what they're up to,
but they'll still be able to go back to the lab later and decode what they saw.

Just as they figure it out, and look through the telescope to see a blinking object,
the Professor enters the area.

---

After he accosts them for following him into a Soviet military base,
and after they question him about his involvement in all this,
Ilya Zolnerowich enters the Atrium, with a group of Soviet Soldiers.

While the Players are armed, they can't sustain a firefight.
While combat may ensue for a few turns,
they should be made aware that shooting isn't going to advance their cause.

When they surrender, Ilya takes their guns, the grimoire, and the medallion.
He then has a solider announce for him that he is going to test a new technology.

The troops push the Players onto the catwalk.
A group of students from the lab are brought in from the Entrance.
They all have a strange look about them.
Ilya lines them up, and we hear him speak a single word:

> Kill.

The instant he says this, hand to hand combat begins with the brainwashed students.

---

After combat, Ilya smirks, and raises his hand.
His troops raise their guns, ready to execute the students.
However, the Professor pleads to him for their lives.

Ilya concedes, but they are questioned rigorously about what they know.

To stay alive, and make sure they don't reveal that they know anything:

- (**Reassurance 2** / **Flattery 4**) to assuage the Soviet's fears
- (**Conceal 3**) to ensure that the Soviets don't find the documents they stole
- **+1** to each roll if:
	- (**Languages 1**) to ensure they don't miscommunicate anything
- **-1** to each roll if:
    - any Player has **Stability < 5**, as this might be considered suspicious


---

Now, the Players can do nothing, and be subjected to more questioning.
Alternatively, they could also attempt to escape,
and the odds of a successful escape go up after Ilya loses interest and leaves.

To escape, they need:

- (**Fleeing 3** / **Stealth 4**) for each Player
- **-1** to every Player's roll if:
    - (**Fleeing < 3**) for any Player

Jungle (Dusty Path)
The dusty trail leads northeast, into a clearing, and south,
back to the Run-Down Checkpoint.
A warm wind rustles the foliage around you.

>northeast

Jungle (Outside the Observatory)
You're standing in a clearing, outside the Observatory.

>in
(first opening the door)

Observatory (Entrance)
The canopy of the Observatory looms over you.
This is the main entrance to the Observatory.
There's a door leading out, and a door which leads in, to the Atrium.
The wrought iron trusses of the Observatory's canopy creak in the wind.

You close the exterior door behind you as you enter.

>in
(first opening the Door to the Observatory.)

Observatory (Atrium)
The canopy of the Observatory looms over you.
You stand underneath a grand optical telescope,
aimed up into the night sky.
The wind whistles quietly as it blows into the open aperture.

As you enter, you notice Professor Birchwell, sitting alone at a desk.
You stand quietly in the doorway, he hasn't noticed you yet.

You close the metal door very quietly as you enter.

>talk to the professor

"Professor..." you say.

He puts down his pen, and turns to you.

"What are you doing here?" he intones.


(You could ask him about the soviet troops you saw him with,
tell him you're researching, or leave, very quickly.)

>ask him about the soviets

"We saw you speaking to some Soviet troops earlier." you say.

The professor becomes visibly angry with you.

"Since you know so much already,
I take it you won't have any questions for them when they arrive?"

"What?  You-"

"-Yes.  I have called them.  They will very likely kill you if you stay.
I have warned you before, but you don't seem to get it.
Stay far away from here, do not get involved,
or the consequences will be dire."

"Professor, what you're doing is wrong.  You can't help-"

"-What is it that you think you know about these matters?"

>tell him about documents

"Have you seen what they're researching?"

"What do you mean?"

"Organic control nukes?"

The professor's eyes become very wide.

"You must leave, and you must leave now."

"Why, Professor?"

"Because, Adaline, if they catch you with those papers, they will--"

At this moment, a group of Soviet Troops enters the Atrium.

### Entrance ###
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/observatory-top-entrance.png" style="float:right; width:50%;"/>
This is the main entrance to the Observatory.
There's a door leading out, and a door which leads in, to the Atrium.
The stairs leading up to the Control Room seem especially poorly constructed,
but the stairs down to the catwalk seem fine.
The Exterior door and the Metal door lead out and in, respectively.


### Control Room ###
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/observatory-top-control-room.png" style="float:right; width:50%;"/>
The Control Room sits above the main Atrium.
There are arrays of buttons and switches and controls for the telescope,
and many desks and papers strewn about the area.
There are a set of important looking cabinets along the west wall,
which contain classified documents about the Soviet's secret organic control program.


### Atrium ###
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/observatory.png" style="float:right; width:50%;"/>
Most parts of the Atrium are in the shadow of the Observatory's main attraction.
A grand, refracting telescope is the centerpiece of this Observatory.
It creaks as it rotates on its pivot, but is otherwise solid.
The eyepiece on the telescope is small, and has a rubber pad around its edge.
The Players could see where the telescope is pointed through it,
but only after they calibrate it.


### Other Areas ###

- Jungle Path:
    - road leads north to the Vehicle Checkpoint
    - South goes back to the village, but is out of scope for the mission
- Vehicle Checkpoint:
    - road leads north-south, leads to the clearing around the Observatory
