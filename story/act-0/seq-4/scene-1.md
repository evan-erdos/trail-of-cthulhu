Recalling what Efua told them, the PCs return to the ruins at high-noon.
In proper daylight, they observe a hole cut through the top of one of the pillars.
While the central pillar near the altar is in the shade,
a small, slot in the central pillar is illuminated by the light.

They place The Dreamer's stone carving into the indentation,
and while it fits perfectly, nothing happens.[^light]

[^light]:
    His handmade version of the Tendril Medallion doesn't reflect light.
    They need to find something that does to access the Underwater Grottoes.

Given the description Efua gave them of the medallion,
they rife through their belongings,
to see if they have anything similar to a medallion.[^foil]

[^foil]:
    They need to determine that the medallion would likely be reflective.
    If they put something reflective in the slot, the light from the pillar is reflected.


With proper alignment, they emulate how the genuine article would reflect light,
and the pillar begins to sink into the ground, revealing a passageway.

A steep set of stone stairs lead down.
