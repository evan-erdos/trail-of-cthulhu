They return to the Lab, which has been rebuilt slightly since the fire.
They clean themselves up, and they learn that Professor Birchwell is missing,
and that nobody has seen him since the fire.
They return to the ruins and the village to look for him.
When they arrive at the village, it looks like a warzone.
There are bullet holes everywhere, and villagers are bleeding out in the streets.

Among the wounded they find the girl they saw approach the professor in lecture.
The PCs learn that she is Dolya Petrovna,
a Russian Journalist working for a Soviet media machine.
She reveals that the Soviets were the ones who destroyed the village,
and that they have a hidden Observatory, deep in the jungle.

The PCs set out into the jungle at night to find the Observatory.
After hearing a string of inexplicably horrifying noises coming from the jungle,
they are attacked by another strange, tentacled creature.
This time, however, a Soviet jeep appears down the road,
and as the PCs flee, the jeep gunner kills the beast.

Dolya's leg is still wounded, and she can't move very quickly.
She's taken by the Soviets, who drive off in a different direction.

The PCs follow the tire tracks in the dirt,
and find themselves in a clearing, where an enormous Observatory has been built.

Having found a way in, the PCs begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.

Ilya Zolnerowich and the Professor enter the Observatory.
Ilya has his men take the grimoire and the medallion from them.
Ilya orders his troops to kill the PCs,
but the professor bargains for their lives.
He concedes, and departs with his troops, taking the artefacts with them.

Professor Birchwell is furious with the PCs, and is armed.
He accosts them for meddling, but doesn't seem like he's going to kill them.
He explains that he started the fire at the Lab to destroy his research.
He's not very coherent, but asks them to join him in his research.

When they ask him about the Soviets, he becomes furious.
He reveals as little as he can about what he's doing,
and tries to learn everything he can about what the PCs know.
