title:  Where Are Monsters in Dreams?
---


They arrive at the tent of the so-called Dreaming One, only to find it empty.
They find tracks that lead to a small ocean inlet.
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.
He falls hard, as if he was aiming for the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

They also find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.

The PCs return to the ruins at high-noon, stone carving in-hand,
and find a secret entrance to some underground caves.

As the PCs walk down the stairs of entrance, they hear rumbling.
The entrance begins to collapse, and stone begins to roll down the stairs.

Now, they're a dozen feet underground, and possibly wounded.
While they're still in the dark, they're attacked by something.
It's slimy, it has tentacles, and it doesn't appear to be touching the ground.

Once they defeat the creature, they assess their surroundings.
They're in a damp, underground grotto, and they can faintly hear running water.
They explore for some time, but cannot find any other exits.

As they approach the underground river, the PCs begin to have a strange sensation.
Very strange things begin to happen to them, and they find their way outside.

They exit the cavern, and find themselves along the shore.
