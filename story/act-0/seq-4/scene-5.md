The PCs and Dolya are returning to the Village.
It's become quite windy, and it's very dark out.


~~~
EXT. RUINS ALONG THE COAST - MIDNIGHT

As they walk back to the village,
DOLYA asks the STUDENTS if she can see the MEDALLION.

DOLYA
It looks like a key.

STUDENTS
What do you mean?

DOLYA
(examining the MEDALLION)
It has notches and... and grooves in it.
It looks like a key.

BORST
So what if it is a key?

DOLYA
That means it unlocks something.

BORST
Yes, that's plain.

DOLYA
ILYA told us he wanted to make sure the PROFESSOR's research wasn't harmful, yes?
What would he do with this sort of thing?
Who's to say he doesn't take it from us, and use it?

BORST
I have it on good authority that he is, how you say...
a well-reasoned man.
He has been good to us.

DOLYA
Yes, exactly. Why? I don't trust him.

Dolya returns the Medallion to the PCs, putting the decision in their hands.
They return to the Village base, and clean themselves up.
