Ilya Zolnerowich and the Professor enter the Observatory.
Ilya has his men take the Grimoire and the medallion from them.
Ilya orders his troops to kill the PCs,
but the professor bargains for their lives.
He concedes, and departs with his troops, taking the artefacts with them.

Professor Birchwell is furious with the PCs, and is armed.
He accosts them for meddling, but doesn't seem like he's going to kill them.
He explains that he started the fire at the Lab to destroy his research.[^0]
He's not very coherent, but asks them to join him in his research.

When they ask him about the Soviets, he becomes furious.
He reveals as little as he can about what he's doing,
and tries to learn everything he can about what the PCs know.

The Professor gives up, and departs, giving them a final warning:

> Go back to the Lab, and stay there.
> These men will kill you if they see you again.
> Never speak of this to anybody, or there will be dire consequences.


[^0]: It was also an insane attempt to drive Cthuhu out of his mindâ€¨.
