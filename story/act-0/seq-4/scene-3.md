Having no other recourse, they go deeper, and find an underground river.
As they approach the water, the PCs begin to have a strange sensation.
It's like they're dreaming awake, and they have a sense of nostalgia.
The mental noise becomes deafening, and they feel compelled to swim in the water.

The water seems to be running much more rapidly, and the water appears to be glowing.
Perhaps it's glowing because they're near the end, and it's flowing outside.
On the other hand, it might be flowing deeper underground,
and the light is coming from upstream, which would be completely unreachable.

They could either spend their time trying to climb the ledge they found earlier,
or brave it, and swim downstream in the hopes that it leads out.

If they try to climb, it takes twice as long, and there's a risk of injury.
However, the experience they had when they only touched the water was rather severe.
Swimming in it might be destabilizing.

If they climb the ledge, they find that it doesn't lead out,
but it reveals that the underground river opens into a larger cavern downstream.

The only egress appears to be through the water.
