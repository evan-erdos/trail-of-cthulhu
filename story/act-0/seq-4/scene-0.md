They arrive at the tent of the so-called Dreaming One, only to find it empty.
Looking closer, the PCs notice a hole in the side of the tent,
and a bunch of strange, slithering markings leading downhill.

Following the tracks, the PCs find themselves in a small ocean inlet.Â 
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
Suddenly, the waterline recesses, nearly draining the inlet.

The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.[^0]
He falls hard, as if he was aiming for the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

The PCs approach the body.[^1]

They also find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.[^2]
Despite the waves and the impact, his hand still firmly grasps the carving.[^3]

Wrenching his hand open, they take a closer look at the carving.
He clearly spent all his time making it, as it bears countless tool marks.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.


[^0]: Possession by Hastur causes the yellow sign to appear somewhere on the body.
[^1]: **{ Forensics }**: determine that the wound was self-inflicted.
[^2]: This is his attempt to create his own Tendril Medallion.
[^3]:
    This would imply that *rigor mortis* had already taken hold,
	but they witnessed him stand up, and throw himself into the sea.
