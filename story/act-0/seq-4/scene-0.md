They arrive at the tent of the so-called Dreaming One, only to find it empty.
Looking closer, the PCs notice a hole in the side of the tent,
and a bunch of strange, slithering markings leading downhill.

Following the tracks, the PCs find themselves in a small ocean inlet.Â 
They observe a man, prostrate on a large boulder at the water's edge.
Suddenly, the waterline recesses, nearly draining the inlet.

The man rises, and reveals a horrible wound in his stomach.[^wound]
He falls hard, as if he was being pushed into the ground.
He impacts head-first as the water swells back in,
twisting his shattered frame against the rocky outcrop.

[^wound]:
    Possession by Hastur causes the yellow sign to appear somewhere on the body.

The PCs notice something running away very quickly, into the jungle to the north.
At the same time, the body of the Dreaming One goes limp.
Investigating the area, they find a stray sheet of paper with a glyph on it.

The PCs approach the body.[^body]

[^body]:
    **{ Forensics }**:
    If they're observant, they determine that the wound was self-inflicted.

They find that he's still clutching a little stone carving.
Despite the waves and the impact, his hand still firmly grasps it.[^stone]

[^stone]:
    This is his attempt to create his own Tendril Medallion.
    This would imply that *rigor mortis* had already taken hold,
    but they witnessed him stand up, and throw himself into the sea.
    This is a direct result of the Professor's incantation.

Wrenching his hand open, they take a closer look at the carving.
He clearly spent all his time making it, as it bears countless tool marks.
It's round, with short tendrils around its edge.
