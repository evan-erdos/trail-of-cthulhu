Having found a way in, the PCs begin to gather information.
They rife through desks and drawers, read documents, and find some instructions.
The instructions describe, in explicit detail,
how to sync the Observatory's telescope with a moving object.

They follow the instructions, and see a blinking object[^0] through the telescope.
Using the charts and telemetry they find in the desks,
they decode and record what the blinking object is sending for later evaluation.
