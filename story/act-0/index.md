title:  Strange Ã†ons
---


The PCs are studying late antiquity Roman ruins in Northern Africa,
under the tutelage of Professor Cameron Trenton Birchwell,
purported to be more of an academic than a doctor,
who was sent to the area to diagnose a rash of sleep disturbances,
reported by many local tribes.
Shortly into the expedition, the Professor begins to act erratically.
A fire breaks out at their lab, and the PCs are left to pick up the pieces.
They take part in a strange ritual, and are trapped in strange ruins.
After they escape, they travel to a hidden Observatory in the jungle,
and learn a horrible secret about the Soviet presence in North Africa.
