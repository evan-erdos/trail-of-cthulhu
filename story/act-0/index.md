title:  Strange Ã†ons
---


A strange affliction has affected nearly every settlement along the Northern coast of Africa.
Reports of horrible sleep disturbances and nightmares abound,
and have recently become so frequent as to warrant international intervention.

Professor Cameron Trenton Birchwell was one of the first to volunteer his services,
despite his reputation of being more an academic than a doctor.

Having gathered a team of researchers, students, and other staff,
the Professor sets off to diagnose and treat the villages.

Shortly into the expedition, the Professor begins to act erratically.
A fire breaks out at their lab, and the students are left to pick up the pieces.
When the students follow the Professor to a hidden Observatory in the jungle,
they learn a horrible truth about the Professor, and his research.
