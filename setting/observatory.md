A secret Observatory nestled in the jungle, run by the Soviets.

### Entrance ###

This is the main entrance to the Observatory.
There's a door leading out, and a door which leads in, to the Atrium.
The stairs leading up to the Control Room seem especially poorly constructed,
but the stairs down to the catwalk seem fine.
The Exterior door and the Metal door lead out and in, respectively.


### Control Room ###

The Control Room sits above the main Atrium.
There are arrays of buttons and switches and controls for the telescope,
and many desks and papers strewn about the area.
There are a set of important looking cabinets along the west wall,
which contain classified documents about the Soviet's secret organic control program.


### Atrium ###

Most parts of the Atrium are in the shadow of the Observatory's main attraction.
A grand, refracting telescope is the centerpiece of this Observatory.
It creaks as it rotates on its pivot, but is otherwise solid.
The eyepiece on the telescope is small, and has a rubber pad around its edge.
The Players could see where the telescope is pointed through it,
but only after they calibrate it.
