A temporary encampment for the students and staff,
to live and study in as they research the ruins.

The main laboratory is the main center of research and study,
whereas the dormitory clusters (located to the south) are quiet and underused.
Much of the day is spent in the field, students and faculty included.

Northwest of the center complex are the Staging Grounds.
Jeeps and supplies are kept in makeshift garages, ready for the next expedition.
