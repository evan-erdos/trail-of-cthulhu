An underground river flows beneath the Ruins, which sit along a coastal inlet.
At the focal point of the Ruins, there is an entrance to a small network of caves.

The Grottoes are wet, cold, and dark, but these caves harbor plant life.
Photosynthetic life should not be able to survive in a dark cave.
Nevertheless, flora are thriving among the cragged stone walls,
and along the banks of the underground river.

Many of the passages are too small for the PCs to explore,
and it's quite easy to get lost in the numerous, twisting passages.
