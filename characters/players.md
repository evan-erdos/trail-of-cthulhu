### Adaline Braun ###

#### Wants ####
Adaline seeks power, strength, and political influence via manipulation.
However, she uses her capacity for the benefit of herself and others,
more often seeking to do good than evil.

#### Tools ####
Adaline has a cutting perception of the human condition,
and is capable of bending social interactions to her will.
She can instantly determine a person's flaws and weaknesses,
and can twist and deflect the insecurities of men towards themselves,
or, perhaps more devastatingly, towards each other.

#### Flaws ####
The worst part is, she knows it: she's acutely aware that she has this power.
Sometimes, the temptation to use such damaging techniques for untoward purposes overwhelms her.

#### Role ####
Adaline is the moral reflection of Ilya, but the differences end there.
She employs the same divisive methods that he uses,
but she seeks to do good with her ability.

#### Common Knowledge ####
Adaline is a German student, with a talent for engineering but a passion for leadership.
Looking at her, one might assume she had just wandered in from a desert of some sort.
Her emaciated frame and frazzled ponytail make her demeanor seem misleadingly frail.
However, one glance from her wide and piercing blue eyes is enough to cut through stone.
Even though she is capable of staring right through people and tearing their emotions asunder,
she wasn't always such a cunning mastermind.
In fact, she had a rather ordinary childhood.
In her teens she became infatuated with tyrannical dictators for a year or two,
but at some point, she learned not to be so open about her interests.

Originally from a rural farming community in Kansas,
your parents sent you away aboard a Greyhound bus after a Hastur-worshiping cult
(which you parents had joined) tried to sacrifice you to save their crops from the Dust Bowl.
You got a job as barkeep in Arkham, and enrolled in Miskatonic University’s biology program,
mostly to rid yourself of your unassailable feelings of ennui and dread.
Then, in your final semester,
you found an advert calling for applications to an academic program in North Africa,
just south of Cairo...
