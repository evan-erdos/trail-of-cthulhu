To impress Stalin so that one day he can climb up the ranks of the Cheka,
and give his children a brighter start than his own.
By presenting Stalin with the dodecahedron he will return to Stalin’s favour.

---


### Fears ###

> that I will die in this godforsaken land,
> leaving my wife a widow and children beggars on the street.

---


### Tools ###

Charismatic attitude, and a deep knowledge of human emotion.
Though he’s never been schooled,
Borst is no stranger to the human condition and can often get the upper hand in both verbal and physical altercations.

---


### Flaws ###

Isn’t always the most honest person.
Living on the street has taught Borst to lookout for himself above all else.
Not that he isn’t trustworthy, he is, but his personal survival comes first.

---


### Role ###

The trusted reporter of the Russian military.
Rumor has it that he was best friends with one of
Stalin’s favorite bastard children. After Borst’s parents were killed in a freak fire,
Stalin gave him the honor of joining the military,
he is Stalin’s eyes and ears in the Africa operations.
Driven by love of his life, Adela.

---


### Common Knowledge ###

After being led to the military by Stalin,
Borst quickly proved he wasn’t grunt material.
His sharp tongue and sharp shooting caught the attention of his superiors.
They tried to have him removed for brawling with officers several times,
but Stalin wouldn’t allow it.
Eventually an agreement was reached and Borst joined the special operations intelligence unit `Cheka`.
While training for Cheka Borst met the beautiful Adela,
a secretary who won his heart.
At first she was hesitant but eventually his charisma and wit softened her.
They were secret lovers for time being until Adela became pregnant.
Fearing for her financial future Adela tried to abort the children,
but Borst caught her in the nick of time.
She then dissapeared from work one day and in secret gave birth to twins; a boy and a girl.
However, due to the secrecy of the childbirth the birthplace was unsanitary and Adela became very sick.
Borst was forced to seek medical help revealing their love.
The price of Adela leaving Cheka was death.
Borst wrote to Stalin begging him for mercy swearing fealty to his country.
A furious Stalin intervened with the punishment under one condition:
that Borst promise to put nothing before Mother Russia ever again.
If he broke this promise his wife and children would be put to death,
and he would banished into the tundra to survive on his own.
Agreeing, Borst undertook the Africa campaign where he writes correspondence directly to Stalin.
His intelligence gathering has led him to an area where strange dreams seem to be linked to telepathy and mind control.
Borst has been placed under Chief Commander Ilya Zolnerowich who takes orders from Stalin.
Strangely most of Stalin’s orders are informed by Borst himself.
Borst and llya don’t see eye to eye because he Ilya is so quiet, cold, and uncharasmatic.
Borst sometimes wonders if the Chief Commander is even human.
