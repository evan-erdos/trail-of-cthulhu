Professor Cameron Trenton Birchwell
-----------------------------------

![profile][]

### Role ###

Prof. Birchwell is the head of the Biomedical Department at Miskatonic University,
and is currently leading a research expedition in Northern Africa.
He studies both Epidemiology and Psychology, and while he does teach,
he is more interested in his research.
While he is accomplished,
his reputation has been tarnished by accusations of ethical misconduct.
While the University has said nothing,
other members of the University staff have their own opinions of him.
He has traveled the world to study the spread of disease,
and does not seem to mind the sight of death or human suffering.
Some have said he’s simply experienced or jaded,
but professors who have known him longer claim that he has always been this way.

### Common Knowledge ###

The professor is only slightly less intelligent than he claims to be,
but he claims quite a bit.
He has gone on research expeditions before,
and the students who accompanied him on those expeditions have nothing but gossip and ghost stories about him.
The University has yet to do anything about the rumors,
but at this point, it may be willful ignorance.
His behaviour has only recently become more erratic than his baseline level of “eccentricity”.

---


### Wants ###

Professor Birchwell carries out his research in the hopes of someday being the man who discovered a secret of the human brain,
or some kind of a cure to a previously-incurable disease.
This conflicts with his desire to lose himself in the places he visits.
He believes that he would feel more at home in the jungles of South America or among ruins and tribes in Northern Africa than he feels when he’s in his office at the University.

### Tools ###

The professor has an army of graduate student researchers at his disposal,
who are capable of moving mountains of paper for him.
He is the administrator of a well-equipped laboratory in Northern Africa, and has tenure.

---

### Flaws ###

Allegations have been made that he violated the University’s code of ethics on numerous occasions,
but the University never took action.
His accusers were wrong at the time,
but on his latest expedition he has made a number of questionable decisions regarding the use of human test subjects.

### Quote ###

> In the coming month, I want each of you to take an action you know to be morally wrong,
> precisely because you know it to be morally wrong,
> and write an essay of whatever length you please about the experience, typewritten only.
> I expect to see all of you up early tomorrow for the expedition north into the ruins.
> Class dismissed.
