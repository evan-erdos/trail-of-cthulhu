### Role ###
Prof. Birchwell is the head of the Biomedical Department at Miskatonic University,
and is currently leading a research expedition in Northern Africa.
He studies both Epidemiology and Psychology, and while he does teach,
he is more interested in his research.
Although he is revered for his intellect and research,
his reputation has been tarnished by accusations of ethical misconduct.

The University has said nothing, however,
other members of the University staff have their own opinions of him.
He has traveled the world to study the spread of disease,
and does not seem to mind the sight of death or human suffering.
Some have said he’s simply experienced or jaded,
but professors who have known him longer claim that he has always been this way.


### Common Knowledge ###
The professor is only slightly less intelligent than he claims to be, but he claims quite a bit.
He has gone on research expeditions before,
and the students who accompanied him on those expeditions have nothing but gossip and stories about him.
The University has yet to do anything about the rumors,
but at this point, it may be willful ignorance.
His behaviour has only recently become more erratic than his baseline level of "eccentricity".


### Wants ###
Professor Birchwell carries out his research in the hopes of curing mankind of mental illnesses.
This conflicts with his desire to lose himself in the places he visits.
He believes that he would feel more at home in the jungles of South America,
or among ruins and tribes in Northern Africa than he feels when he’s in his office at the University.

He seeks the Mask of Hastur to cure his wife of her dementia.
Even though he's spent his life studying medicine, he cannot save her.
He thinks he can use the Mask to get inside her mind, and cure her.


### Tools ###
The professor has an army of graduate student researchers at his disposal,
who are capable of moving mountains of paper for him.
He is the administrator of a well-equipped laboratory in Northern Africa, and has tenure.


### Flaws ###
Allegations have been made that he has repeatedly violated the University’s code of ethics.
During his latest expedition, he has made a number of questionable decisions.

He can become so absorbed in a problem that he loses his perspective.
Specifically regarding his quest to save his wife,
he has become so desperate to save her that he's agreed to work with the Soviets,
and to try to use an ancient relic to cure her.
