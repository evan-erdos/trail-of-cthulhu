### Role ###
she is mostly stone-faced; humor usually goes over her head,
and her relationships with her professional peers are a little shaky because of this
(and because of her tendency to isolate herself for long periods of time).


### Common Knowledge ###
She grew up homeless on the streets of St Petersburg, taking odd jobs here and there.
One day, she ran into a man named Grigori, a Pravda staff writer who was distributing Pravda papers,
and she helped him out, managing to sell 40 some-odd papers in only a few minutes.
He took her into his apartment, taught her Russian,
and after several years of selling papers on street corners, she got a position at Pravda.
At first this elated her, because it showed her that this system
(communism) could level the playing field for people who came from nothing like she did.
But then, one day, after she left her own newly-acquired apartment and arrived at work,
Grigori was nowhere to be found.
She searched his desk and found a mysterious parcel;
apparently he had been looking into a high-ranking army official called Ilya Zolnerowich.
She hid this parcel in the floorboards beneath her desk,
so that not even surprise inspections conducted by the NKVD could uncover it.
After a few years, she attained the position of editor,
and now sometimes stays locked up in her office for hours on end; her workers have no real idea why.

### Wants ###
She wants to alter perceptions


### Tools ###
She has


### Flaws ###
