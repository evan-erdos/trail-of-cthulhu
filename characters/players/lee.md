You and your father never really saw eye-to-eye.
He made you do the Boy Scouts, go hunting, and fence.
But you wanted to do art with your Mother at her womens club.

You and Bus would often spend the night, not sleeping at all.
Some women speak of strange visions your mother had,
usually about ancient lost artworks being unearthed in Africa.
