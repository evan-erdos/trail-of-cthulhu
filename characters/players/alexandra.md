### Pillars of Sanity ###
- Hard work begets a clear mind
- Behind every false god lies a perfectly rational scientific explanation


### Sources of Stability ###
- her yellow topaz necklace, a gift from her parents and her only remaining connection to them
- George Henderson, her former boss and confidant at the “Bear and Bowler” pub


### Wants ###
She needs to rid herself of these unassailable feelings of ennui and dread, however,
the very process of exploring and learning about the Mythos is actively harmful to her.
She needs to learn about her past, but being so logical, she cannot accept the Mythos as truth.
The only way she can grow is by accepting it,
so that she can gain new insights and understanding into her childhood experiences.

### Tools ###
- Biologist (student):
  - Refresh one pool point in Biology, Geology, Pharmacy or Forensics (Max 4)
  - use one Cthulhu Mythos or Occult pool point to either:
      - refresh one sanity point
      - two stability points for another player


### Common Knowledge ###
Originally from a rural farming community in Kansas,
Alexandra Hayes' parents sent her away aboard a Greyhound bus after a Hastur-worshiping cult
(which her parents had joined) tried to sacrifice her to save their crops from the Dust Bowl.
She got a job as a barkeep in Arkham and enrolled in Miskatonic University’s Biology program,
mostly to rid herself of the unassailable feelings of ennui and dread she has about her past.
In her final semester, she learns that the revered Professor Birchwell is seeking assistance,
and is calling for applications to his research program in North Africa, just south of Cairo.
