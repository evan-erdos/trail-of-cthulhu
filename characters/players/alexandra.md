### Pillars of Sanity ###
- Hard work begets a clear mind
- Behind every false god lies a perfectly rational scientific explanation


### Sources of Stability ###
- your yellow topaz necklace, a gift from your parents and your only remaining connection to them
- George Henderson, your former boss and confidant at the “Bear and Bowler” pub


### Wants ###
She needs to rid herself of these horrible preemonitions.
The very process of exploring and learning about the Mythos is actively harmful to her,
but she needs to do it, so that she can attach new meaning and understanding to things that she experienced as a child.


### Tools ###
Biologist (student):

- Refresh one pool point in Biology, Geology, Pharmacy or Forensics (Max 4)
- use one Cthulhu Mythos or Occult pool point to either:
  - refresh one sanity point
  - two stability points for another player

You got a job as barkeep in Arkham, and enrolled in Miskatonic University’s biology program,
mostly to rid yourself of your unassailable feelings of ennui and dread.
Then, in your final semester,
you found an advert calling for applications to an academic program in North Africa,
just south of Cairo...
