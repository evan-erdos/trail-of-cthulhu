Brainstorming
-------------


### Tone ###

- imitate arcane, "Lovecraftian" tone, archaic spellings?

- horror, an absolutely crushing sense of worthlessness

- Nihilism, dread, despair, suspense, etc.

- Don't necessarily need to stick strictly to canon

- supernatural vs. rational explanation

- use / invent kennings

- frequent references to Greek Mythos


### Lovecraftian Idiosyncrasies ###

- pandæmoniac -> ... lover of.. pandemonium?

- cachinnation -> loud laughter

- fantasm -> phantasm

- artefact -> artifact

- fœtid -> fetid

- grimoire -> archaic occult tomes

- lugubrious -> sad & dismal

- effulgence -> shining brightly; radiant, joyfulness

- lanthorn -> lantern

- thatamaturge -> wizard-mage

- ichor -> "that fluid which flows in the veins of the gods"

- tenebrous -> dark, shadowy, obscure...

- "nightmares & phantasies"

- "Strange Æons" -> don't even know, sounds super weird!

- "Cthulhu Phtagn"

- "In his house at R'lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming"

- "Dripping Babylon of Elder Dæmons"

- "Erebrus of Titan Toadstools"


### Writing Tactics ###

- false sense of security

- retrospective foreshadowing

- misplacement of trust

- story-driven puzzle solving (Myst / Riven)

- reward inventive use of spells for unintended goals


Story
-----


### Act I ###

- Mysterious death, relevant to the players

- Some sort of mentor is corrupted by an `Outer God`

  * strange dreams, research leads him to an artefact?

  * Attempts to kill the players, the players beat him

  * they have nothing left after killing him, and leave town

  * they continue his research, and later find out he's alive!

- Professor makes a deal for his soul, and be resurrected

- a Hannibal-esque plot, dealing with an `Outer God` indirectly

  * e.g., Hannibal in his cell, causing havoc.

  * `Cthulhu` sleeping, perhaps the goal is to keep him asleep?

- follow in footsteps through letters / documents

- be openly antagonized by the Professor / Mentor

- other kinds of epistolary storytelling

- investigating a derelict ship

- finding a gigantic carcass in the middle of the ocean


### Act II-III ###

- Raiding cults, learn "the truth" progressively via cult info?

- Chasing around the Professor, following his footsteps

- Continuing the Professor's research as a plot development


### Act IV ###

- Actions of players determine the exposure of a dead city
