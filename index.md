A Lovecraftian horror story, written for the Trail of Cthulhu Game System.


A group of students embark on an expedition to Northern Africa,
at the behest of their revered research professor, Professor Cameron Trenton Birchwell.
Having gathered a team of researchers and students to travel with him,
and despite his reputation of being more like an academic than a doctor,
Birchwell has set out to diagnose and cure a strange disease,
reported by tribes and villages all across the Northern coast.

Not long into their expedition, a fire breaks out at the lab, and the Professor goes missing.
The students are left to fend for themselves, and as they struggle to get home,
they learn a horrible secret about the Soviet presence in North Africa.
