### Scene 4 : *Diplomacy with Necromancers* ###

If the `Players` go to town or back to the ruins, they learn of a new ritual.
When they investigate it, they discover a horrific scene.
There are a mix of tribespeople and students around a bloody altar,
all chanting in unison about a demon saviour.
They learn that there will be a sacrifice,
and that another student has volunteered to be sacrificed.
They are told that if they perform his *coup de grâce*,
then they'll be in good standing with the chief,
and must decide if they want to kill him, or plead for his life.

The `Players` come across **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** in the jungle.
**BIRCHWELL** talks of strange dreams, and of an *artefact*.
Then, he nonchalantly attempts to kill the `Players`.
**BIRCHWELL** reaches calmly for a gun, on sight.
Combat ensues, and the `Players` enfeeble him.
Then, the `Players` could:
  * perform **BIRCHWELL**'s *coup de grâce*
  * try to take **BIRCHWELL** with them
Either way, the `Players` are separated from **BIRCHWELL** before they can act.
