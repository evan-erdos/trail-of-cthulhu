Act 0 Structure
---------------

### Setting ###
The Students are studying late Antiquity Roman Ruins in Northern Africa,
under the tutelage of Professor Cameron T. 'Trenton' **BIRCHWELL**.


### Inciting Incident ###
The students wake up, with the Laboratory burning around them.
They must find their way out into the cold, but thawing morning.


### Complication ###
The Students uncover the professor's research, but it's completely incoherent.
They cannot make out what he's done, and if they want to learn what's going on,
they're going to have to track him down and question him.


### Crisis ###
Having tracked him down, the students confront the Professor in the jungle.
They can attack the professor, talk to him about where he's been, etc.


### Clues ###
- The students are behaving like madmen
- Some parts of the Lab aren't burned, they've been smashed
- The professor's notes are incoherent, completely unhelpful


### Resolution ###
They find the Professor, realize what he's done, and now have to continue.
They have to stop what the Professor has started.
