### Scene 1 : *"...which is a building, which is on fire.."* ###

`Players` don't get to the assignment, because the building catches on fire.
They awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their warm rooms and brewing coffee to escape.
On their way out, they observe some of their peers presenting really disturbing behaviours.

An **INCENSED STUDENT** bars the door as they try to leave, they can:
  * kill the **INCENSED STUDENT** to escape
  * leave the **INCENSED STUDENT** to his fate
  * actively attempt to save the **INCENSED STUDENT**

They rush out, into the "thawing frost of a new day".
Here, they are confronted by another student, who asks:

> Do you know where the good professor **BIRCHWELL** is?
>
> Oh dear, oh no! He's still inside! W-W-we have to *save* him!

Then, the `Players` reenter building, looking for **BIRCHWELL**.
The building is still on fire, and the students still inside are dying.
Any surviving students they meet are behaving like madmen.

As the `Players` travel through a section of the building which has caved in, they come across a **CRYING STUDENT**.
The **CRYING STUDENT** is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.
If the `Players` attempt to save him (or if they mention there's a window he can escape through), he says:

> No! You can't! Don't leave! I have to get through! No! NO!

If they ask what he means, he says:

> The door! The door! If I don't get through, they'll kill me!

If they continue to try to reason with him, he attacks, or something. I don't really care.
