### Scene 1 ###

`Players` don't get to the assignment, because the building catches on fire.
They awake to the sound of sirens, and must flee their warm rooms and brewing coffee to escape.
On their way out, they observe some of their peers presenting really disturbing behaviours.

As the `Players` travel through a section of the building which has caved in, they come across a **CRYING STUDENT**. 
The **CRYING STUDENT** is clawing so vigorously into his door that his fingers are bleeding.
If the `Players` attempt to save him (or if they mention there's a window he can escape through), he says:

> No! You can't! Don't leave! I have to get through! No! NO!

If they ask what he means, he says:

> The door! The door! If I don't get through, they'll kill me!

If they continue to try to reason with him, he attacks, or something. I don't really care.

Finally, they find the door to Professor **BIRCHWELL**'s office.
If they try to feel the door, it is warm to the touch.
A dim, orange glow can be seen flickering under the door.
