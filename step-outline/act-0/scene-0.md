### Scene 0 : *An Unusual Lecture* ###

`Players` are all students at Miskatonic University, (in Dunwich, Massachusetts, along the eponymous river).
Naturally, the `Players` have varying skills and abilities, ranging from psychology to military training.
Professor Cameron T. **BIRCHWELL** is beloved by all, but behaves strangely one day in lecture.
He gives the whole class a very strange assignment:

> For homework, I want each of you to do something you know to be ethically wrong.
> Come to the next lecture with half a page about the experience.
>
> Or... don't. It's all... pointless anyways... Class is dismissed early.

**BIRCHWELL** is, in fact, under the influence of an `Outer God`.
