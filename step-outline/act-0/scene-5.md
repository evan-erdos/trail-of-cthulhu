### Scene 5 : *The Professor* ###

The `Players` come across **PROFESSOR BIRCHWELL** in the jungle.
**BIRCHWELL** talks of strange dreams, and of an *artefact*.
He asks them to give him his notebook back.
When they refuse, he nonchalantly attempts to kill the `Players`.
**BIRCHWELL** reaches calmly for a gun, on sight.
Combat ensues, and the `Players` enfeeble him.
Then, the `Players` could:
  * perform **BIRCHWELL**'s *coup de gr√¢ce*
  * try to take **BIRCHWELL** with them
Either way, the `Players` are separated from **BIRCHWELL** before they can act.
