### Scene 2 : *The Professor* ###

Finally, the `Players` come across the door to Professor **BIRCHWELL**'s office.
A dim, orange glow can be seen flickering under the door.
If they try to feel the door, it is warm to the touch.
As they enter, they are greeted with the sight of their professor.
Professor **BIRCHWELL** sits, scribbling away madly, at his desk.
The room is ablaze, fire consumes his bookshelf and his window curtains.
**BIRCHWELL** talks of strange dreams, and of an *artefact*.
Then, he nonchalantly attempts to kill the `Players`.
**BIRCHWELL** reaches calmly for a gun, on sight.
Combat ensues, and the `Players` enfeeble him.
Then, the `Players` could:
  * perform **BIRCHWELL**'s *coup de gr√¢ce*
  * try to take **BIRCHWELL** with them
Either way, the `Players` are separated from **BIRCHWELL** before they can act.
The `Players` leave **BIRCHWELL** in the burning building, saving themselves.
